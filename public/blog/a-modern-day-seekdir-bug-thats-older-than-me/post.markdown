Take a gander at <a href="http://www.vnode.ch/fixing_seekdir">Fixing seekdir()</a>, an account of quashing a bug in the <acronym title="Berkley Software Distribution">BSD</acronym> directory libraries.  This is a very interesting piece of UNIX history, and probably still exists in the most recent versions of Apple's OSX.

My favorite part?
