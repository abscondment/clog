Things are a little on edge because I'm being tested for <a href="http://www.lymphoma.org/site/PageServer?pagename=learning&amp;JServSessionIdr003=g9ox9vepi1.app5b">lymphoma</a>.  It's really unlikely that I have anything serious; my sickness is so infrequent, a blip during periods of complete normalcy.  But, just to be sure...

Of course, I hope that I don't have it.  I guess I'm a little afraid, but if that's God's will for me then so be it.

<i>Ts&eacute;gihi</i>.<br />
House made of dawn,<br />
House made of evening light,<br />
House made of dark cloud,<br />
House made of male rain,<br />
House made of dark mist,<br />
House made of female rain,<br />
House made of pollen,<br />
House made of grasshoppers,<br />
Dark could is at the door.<br />
The trail out of it is dark cloud.<br />
The zigzag lightning stants high upon it.<br />
Male deity!<br />
Your offering I make.<br />
I have prepared a smoke for you.<br />
Restore my feet for me,<br />
Restore my legs for me,<br />
Restore my body for me,<br />
Restore my mind for me.<br />
This very day take out your spell for me.<br />
Your spell remove for me.<br />
You have taken it away for me;<br />
Far off it has gone.<br />
Happily I recover.<br />
Happily my interior becomes cool.<br />
Happily I go forth.<br />
My interior feeling cool, may I walk.<br />
No longer sore, may I walk.<br />
Impervious to pain, may I walk.<br />
With lively feelings, may I walk.<br />
As it used to be long ago, may I walk.<br />
Happily may I walk.<br />
Happily, with abundant dark clouds, may I walk.<br />
Happily, with abundant showers, may I walk.<br />
Happily, with abundant plants, may I walk.<br />
Happily may I walk.<br />
Being as it used to be long ago, may I walk.<br />
May it be beautiful before me,<br />
May it be beautiful behind me,<br />
May it be beautiful below me,<br />
May it be beautiful above me,<br />
May it be beautiful all around me.<br />
In beauty it is finished.<br />
