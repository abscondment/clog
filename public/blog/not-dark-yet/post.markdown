<p>
I think I'm going to start posting a daily picture of myself... lets see... yeah.  I will.
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p><i>Shadows are falling and I've been here all day<br />
It's too hot to sleep time is running away<br />
Feel like my soul has turned into steel<br />
I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal<br />
There's not even room enough to be anywhere<br />
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there</i></p>
<p><i>Well my sense of humanity has gone down the drain<br />
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain<br />
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind<br />
She put down in writing what was in her mind<br />
I just don't see why I should even care<br />
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there</i></p>
<p><i>Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paree<br />
I've followed the river and I got to the sea<br />
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies<br />
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes<br />
Sometimes my burden seems more than I can bear<br />
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there</i></p>
<p><i>I was born here and I'll die here against my will<br />
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still<br />
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb<br />
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from<br />
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer<br />
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.</i></p>
