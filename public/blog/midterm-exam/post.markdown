"don't open your eyes you won't like what you see&nbsp;&nbsp;the devils of truth steal the souls of the free&nbsp;&nbsp;don't open your eyes take it from me&nbsp;&nbsp;i have found&nbsp;&nbsp;you can find&nbsp;&nbsp;happiness is slavery" -- Yes Trent, I am a slave to the cross.  It's either that or be a slave to myself; I know which master is better, and you do too.
