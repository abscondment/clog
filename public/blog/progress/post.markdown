My <acronym title="Comparative Literature">Complit</acronym> class was canceled today.  Too bad I found out after biking up to school.

It's actually a good thing, because this way I can get the reading done for my Informatics class.

Things are progressing.  I bought a 450mHz desktop on eBay for $76.  Hopefully over the summer I'll be able to get two more and build that cluster I talked about in the last post.

The website is coming along.  In fact, it's almost done--I just need to write the scripts to allow additions to be made via an interface other than PHPMyAdmin (which, by the way, is an incredible tool).  I'm really excited about it; it looks good, works well, and serves a purpose.

I'm also continuing work on the <a href="http://students.washington.edu/bribera/wit/">What is Truth?</a> site.  Among other things.  I think I do too much; summer sounds really nice right now.
