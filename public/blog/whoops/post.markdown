So, we played poker last night.  A great deal of poker, even.  Until 4:40.  And I was, therefore, really freakin' tired -- so I didn't wake up.  Not on purpose, of course, but I almost knew it was going to happen.  That's two days in a row.  I suck.

Also, I managed to lose $5 because I went all in on the last hand, just for the heck of it.
