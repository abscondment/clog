<p>My roomates (minus Dan) and I just finished watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/">The Return of the King</a>.  The story is beautiful, but I can't help but think of the way our culture twists the story.  Take this answer given by Elijah Wood, for example:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The way that Frodo gets through is ultimately in his will and his courage and his own inner strength and belief that gets him through.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://promontoryartists.org/lookingcloser/movie%20reviews/Q-Z/returnoftheking-elijahwood.htm">full interview</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Responses like Wood's and <a href="http://promontoryartists.org/lookingcloser/lordoftherings-interviews.htm">others'</a> are all too common.  They're all grounded in some form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagianism">Pelagianism</a> (<a href="http://mb-soft.com/believe/txc/semipela.htm">more...</a>, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11604a.htm">more...</a>) or another, leaving the burden of salvation on mankind.  It's sad that one of the main points of an epic like Lord of the Rings, though it be well done in nearly every regard, can be lost on our society.  Men have become convinced of their own ability and, having forgotten God, believe their ability to be self-made--to their detriment.</p>
<p>In other news, I baked a blueberry pie today, and I'm starting up a Java project that I have previously left unfinished.  But first, I need an hour nap.
