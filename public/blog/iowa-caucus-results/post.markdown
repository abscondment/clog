<a href="http://www.wqad.com/Global/story.asp?S=7575472">Obama and Huckabee</a> take Iowa.  I guess <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/index.jhtml?ml_video=85617">Steven Colbert</a> and the <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/72583/">out-of-state college students</a> came through in the end.

That last link is most interesting in light of the following data (taken from <a href="http://www.facebook.com/politics/pulse.php">Facebook's "Politics" application</a>).

The Caucus followed Facebook's gathered data pretty well.  If college students continue to go out and vote in these pre-election elections, I predict Obama will get the Democratic nomination.  The Republican race may be less close in other states, so it's hard to say if students' votes will make much of an impact.  It's also unclear whether candidates besides Obama are actively encouraging college students to vote in the Caucuses.  We'll see, we'll see.
