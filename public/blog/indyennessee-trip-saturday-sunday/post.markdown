We're on vacation in Indyennesse!  We rolled into town Saturday evening, extremely happy to see the Partains and the Robbins once again.  Nathan and Sarah moved from Seattle to Indy last summer, and we've been itching to see them and Amos again.  Beth and Dan are back from <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mi.html">Malawi</a> to give birth to their first, Elijah.

We fell right back into our old routines: eating, laughing, and a hefty dose of "philosophical" reasoning.  Jessica and I had quite a few stories to tell about our eventful traveling, so we spent most of our first two evenings chatting it up.

Sunday morning we headed down to <a href="http://www.redeemindy.org">Redeemer Indy</a> &mdash; Nathan is the Worship Coordinator there, and Jason Dorsey (my former youth group leader from <a href="http://crosspointchurches.org">Green Lake</a>) is the Senior Pastor.  Below is a picture of an interesting art installation they have up in the sanctuary.

We hung out with the Dorseys for a little bit on Monday, but it just made more sense to put the picture in this post.
