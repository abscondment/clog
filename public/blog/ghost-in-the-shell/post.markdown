A while ago, <a href="http://threebrothers.org/jordan/">Jordan</a> introduced me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a>.  It's an interesting anime series focused on the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy, cybernetics, and crime-fighting; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex">first season</a> was really quite impressive.

Much to my surprise, I stumbled across the following video during my daily news consumption.  Exoskeletons like the one demonstrated in this video play a key role in a few <acronym title="Ghost in the Shell">GitS</acronym> episodes, and I'm amazed to see how advanced the real life progress on these frightening machines has become.
