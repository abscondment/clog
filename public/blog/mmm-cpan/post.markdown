I'm installing <a href="http://www.soaplite.com">SOAP::Lite</a> on my Laptop as I write this out.  It's pretty incredible how annoying <a href="http://cpan.org"><acronym title="Comprehensive Perl Archive Network">CPAN</acronym></a> is to configure on a Windows machine.  I had to download a whole bunch of *NIX applications that were ported to Windows... *sigh*

Other news, I got a 4.0 on my Comparative Literature paper (written about <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=0141439564">Great Expectations</a>).  The professor asked if he could have a copy of my essay.  This is in a 200+ person class.  Needless to say, I felt pretty good about that.
