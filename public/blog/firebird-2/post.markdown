I've fallen in love with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/">Firebird</a>.  It's simply the greatest--faster than regular old <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla</a> (which, by the way, is still leagues ahead of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp">Internet Explorer</a> or <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>) and all Firey and Birdey...

yeah...

Ugh.  I'm all sore because we've created a "do some pushups before bed" tradition in my apartment, and I haven't worked out in a while.  I can still sorta crank them out... I'd better keep this up, or I'll be feeling old before I have any reason to.
