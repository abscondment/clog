In sharp contrast to the wonderful church service I attended this morning, I just spent the last few hours trying to figure out how to <a href="http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath279.htm">solve the sum of a k<sup>th</sup> degree power</a>, which it turns out required some <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BernoulliPolynomial.html">Bernoulli Polynomials</a> and other such rot.

Needless to say, I was extremely piqued when I figured out an easy way to do the problem I was working on.

Grr...

Anyway, I have to finish the rest of that assignment and turn it in tomorrow.  But I have a thorough understanding of the sum of powers now.
