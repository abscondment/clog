I'm not going to school today; it's too snowy out.  And, one of my classes was cancelled anyway.  The other one wasn't going to meet today anyway, and I figure that missing the second day of History 209 (The History of Christianity) won't be too big of a problem.  Jessica and are going to play in the snow, thanks to Metro.

Anyway, I'm off to read my Bible and some stuff for school.
