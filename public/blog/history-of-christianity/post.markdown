History 209 (The History of Christianity) is really quite interesting.  Of course, the UW being a (very) secular university, the slant with which it's taught is a little obnoxious; the professor likes to illustrate differences in Christian thought, and emphasize the struggle that it took to reconcile those differences.  We learned about the four Ecumenical (sp?) councils, which were held in the 300-400s to determine the nature of the Trinity and of Jesus.

The textbook we're reading is definately secular.  I was rather annoyed at the way they brushed off the canonization of the New Testament--they mentioned the Muratorian Canon as an early draft, which came about around the year 200, but they stated that the New Testament Canon wasn't actually decided upon until the Council of Trent in 1540.

Frankly, the canon which is used in Protestant churches nowadays was affirmed at <a href="http://www.ntcanon.org/Carthage.canon.shtml">the Third Synod of Carthage</a> in 397.  <a href="http://www.ntcanon.org">http://www.ntcanon.org</a> has a lot of nicely compiled information about this subject.

Jessica has her first math test today.  I have my first midterm next Wednesday, not Friday (as I previously thought).  <a href="http://peopleyoumeet.net">People You Meet</a> is playing another show at <a href="http://www.thecrocodile.com">The Crocodile Cafe</a> downtown on Feb. 10; that's pretty exciting and pretty frustrating.  They need to play an all ages show so that their biggest fans can go (frankly, any show is great and I'm glad for them).

Ugh... I've got statistics homework and other stupid stuff to do; too much to do too do!
