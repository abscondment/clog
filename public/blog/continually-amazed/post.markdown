Here are some things I'm amazed by:</p><ul><li>That Jessica likes me even though I'm really really imperfect.</li><li><a href="http://www.thebricktestament.com">The Brick Testament</a> (rediscovered by visiting <a href="http://lukebrodine.net">Luke Brodine</a>'s website).</li><li>That I got 95% on my Statistics midterm without really going to/paying attention in the lectures; and, that the only reason it wasn't 98% was because I <b>mis-typed on my calculator</b> and wrote down the wrong final answer.  (The 2% off was because I ran out of time while computing a problem; I aced all of the concepts).</li><li>Cell phones.  No, more like the people who have them.  Everyone should have to have a license to own a cell phone.  Honestly.  The number of rude customers at <a href="http://bn.com">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, rude students in classes at <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">The University of Washington</a>, etc. (movies too, of course) is absolutely astounding.  Cell phones should have built in shockers that shock their users when the irritation level of those arround them gets above a certain point.</li><li>God's grace.  Writing this makes me feel a tad shameful for getting so peeved at cell phone people.  :/</li></ul><p>Courses I'm thinking of taking next quarter:
