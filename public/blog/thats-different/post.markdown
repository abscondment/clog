<p>I noticed something weird as I was browsing around my UW account... a grade is posted, already...</p>
<p>How could this be?  My English teacher has put every other class I have ever taken to shame by posting grades waaaay ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>I got a 3.7; I'm quite happy with that.  Other news, I finished my <a href="http://students.washington.edu/bribera/docs/brothersk.doc">Comparative Literature paper on The Brothers Karamazov</a>.</p>
<p>////////// EDIT ///////////</p>
<p>Whoa--I just looked at <a href="http://myuw.washington.edu">MyUW</a>, and my <acronym title="Computer Science Engineering">CSE</acronym> grade was in.  3.9--yeah, baby.</p>
