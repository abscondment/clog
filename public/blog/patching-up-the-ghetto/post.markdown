I'm slightly amused that not a day after I started submitting patches to Rails projects, the Ruby on Rails community was <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html">declared to be a ghetto</a>.

"Whatever," says I; I'm still happy to have done the following:

<ul>
  <li>Had this patch committed to <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/8554#file0">Rails</a>.</li>
  <li>Had this patch committed to <a href="http://err.lighthouseapp.com/projects/466/tickets/172-total_entries-ignored-in-paginate_by_sql">will_paginate</a>.</li>
  <li>Pretty sure this patch will be committed to <a href="http://trac.typosphere.org/ticket/1184">Typo</a> any day.<br /><b>[Update: it's been committed to trunk]</b></li>
</ul>

Paltry, I know; you've got to start somewhere.
