<p>I had a pretty busy day today.  I woke up at 9:34 when Barnes &amp; Noble called to see if I could work; apparently, the entry in my Saturday schedule reading "Jan-0" was supposed to read "10-5".  Since it was their error (and since I had already asked a manager about it, who said it was nothing), I didn't go in.</p>
<p>At 10:30ish I cooked up two nice omelettes with chedder cheese, saut&#233;ed onions, and saut&#233;ed orange bell peppers--one for Dan (who provided the bell peppers) and one for myself.  After showering I headed over to Jessica's.</p>
<p>At noon, I started recording vocals for the <acronym title="Reformed University Fellowship"><a href="http://www.uw.ruf.org">RUF</a></acronym> album.  I sang backup on two songs and lead on one; recording took roughly an hour and forty-five minutes.</p>
<p>I just noticed that I try to spell "forty" with a "u"; am I British, or something?  Anyway.  After recording, Jessica and I went and <a href="http://www.target.com/gp/registry/registry.html/ref=cm_cw_sr_1/601-2320040-5903317?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;type=wedding&amp;id=21NXYSRZYJPL1">registered at Target</a> (we did our <a href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/regGiftRegistry.asp?order_num=-1&amp;wrn=%2D1891529979">Bed Bath and Beyond registry</a> the previous day).  That was a lot of fun--hopefully, we'll get all the stuff we want.  Er... need.</p>
<p>This evening, Jessica and I watched <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0338013/">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</a>.  It was really good.  Jessica wants me to write "grood" instead of "good"; since I'm going to marry her, I think I'll take her advice.  It was really <em>grood</em>.</p>
<p>That's all for now--more coming soon.  By soon I mean "after school is out for Christmas break".</p>
