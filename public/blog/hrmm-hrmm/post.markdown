<p>It's late.<br />Updates:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Finals week is at hand.  I've written a nine page English paper and seven pages of a group report on SPAM for my Informatics class</li>
 <li>I still have to write a 5-7 page paper on The Brothers Karamazov and take two tests.</li>
 <li>The application for <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu">CSE</a> will open soon.  I anticipate rejection.</li>
 <li>On a lighter note, the results for my Informatics application are due soon.  I anticipate success.</li>
 <li>If all else fails, I'd make a great English or History major.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to bed now.  I need some sleep after writing those two papers and then having shaving cream fights with the youth group kids.</p>
