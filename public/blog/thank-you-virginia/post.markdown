The other day I logged in to my <a href="http://movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> interface to update this site.  The first thing I see is that the number of visitor comments has gone up by one, to 71.  "Oooh," I say.  "I wonder who left me a comment..."

So I view the comment.  And it's spam--gross spam.  Absolutely incredible.  Movable Type records the IP address of every poster.  So I continue deeper into the system and pull out the IP, block it, and proceed to <a href="http://visualroute.visualware.com/">VisualRoute</a>.  I trace the IP--they're connecting through a proxy in Virginia.  Gar, I say.

Those stupid H4x0rs.
