"memories of a bike ride hit the present like a fist through a wall"

wake up friend
we're kids again
the rubber fights hard against the trail
what now divides us?
hopes dreams or lies?
the road has bumps, planned ahead
and I'm the one
who opened the van
to let the freeway blow on in
our wheels are slipping
handlebars are grating
blood pours and limbs are stilled
get up, keep going
the line's not far
victory is near at hand
i'm bleeding, too
it's broken me, broken you
someone carries me towards the end
are you still with me?
or alone and dying?
call his help; don't make me lose you, friend
