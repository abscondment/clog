I like Apple.  They've popularized an aura of coolness around things that I thought were cool to begin with: computers and mp3 players.  But I have to question--and even mock--the whole idea of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a>.

Maybe I'm just horribly old-fashioned, but I wasn't even excited about video <em>iPods</em>.  "What's the point?", I ask.  Who needs a miniature multimedia center?  Apple is certainly cashing in on the "cool aura"--they're in a position where they can create products of dubious usefulness, and <a href="http://www.boiseweekly.com/binary/e644f739/Svelte1352.jpg">sell them like hotcakes</a>.

Some wise YouTube soul has felt similar apprehensiveness towards this new amalgamation, and has captured some rather piquant remarks on film:

My sentiments exactly!  I can understand combining a phone with internet browsing capabilities; however, my experience with these technologies tells me that there will be such a dearth of bandwidth that its use will be severely limited.  I can even understand adding 'net consuming "Widgets" to an Internet-read phone.  But I can't believe there will be a day when I'll want my phone to play music, or my mp3 player to play videos.

Then again, I'm an oddball.
