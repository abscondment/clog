More Bright Eyes: "Let's Not Shit Ourselves (To Love and Be Loved)</p><blockquote><p>The animals laugh from the dark of the wilderness. A baby cried hard in an apartment complex,
as I pass a car buried under the influence. The city is driving me out of my mind.
I have seen a child is caught in the sad trap of gravity.
He falls from the lowest branch of the apple tree and lands in the grass and weeps for his dignity.
Next time he will not aim so high. Yeah, next time, neither will I.
A mother takes loans out, sends her kids off to colleges.
Her family is reduced to names on a shopping list.
Meanwhile, a coroner kneels beneath a great, wooden crucifix.
He know that there are worse things than being alone.
I have learned to retreat at the first sign of danger.
I mean, why wait around, if it's just to surrender? Ambition, I have found, can only lead to failure.
I do not read the reviews. No, I am not singing for you.
I stood dropping a coin into the pit of a well. And I would throw my whole billfold
if I thought it would help. With all these wishes I make,
I should by something real, at least a telephone call home.

Well, I awoke in relief. My sheets and tubes were all tangled weak from whiskey and pills,
in a Chicago hospital. My father was there, in a chair, by the window, staring so far away.
I tried talking, just whispered, "...so sorry...so selfish..." He stopped me and said,
"Child I love you regardless and there is nothing you could do that would ever change this.
I'm not angry. It happens. You just can't do it again."
So now I try to keep up, I have been exchanging my currency.
While a million objects pass through my periphery. So now I am rubbing my eyes because
they are starting to bother me. I have been staring too long at the screen.
But where was it when I first heard the sound of humility? It came to my ears in the goddamn
loveliest melody. How grateful I was then to be part of the mystery,
to love and be loved. Let's just hope that is enough.</p></blockquote><p>There's a bit of a cathartic quality to Bright Eyes; he's so sad, and so close to the truth.  Yet, as C. S. Lewis describes in <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0156329301"><i>The Four Loves</i></a>, one can be close in proximity to having love like God's love and distant in terms of actually getting to the point of God's love.  This of course adds to the misery of the music and causes us to remember that "the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot" (<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?SearchType=AND&amp;searchpage=0&amp;search=hostile+God&amp;version=ESV">Romans 8:7</a>).

It reminds me of how I'd get sad over how depressing and melancholy (no pun intended, for you <acronym title="Smashing Pumpkins">SP</acronym> fans) <a href="http://www.billycorgan.com/">Billy Corgan</a> was.  I prayed for him occasionally; it seemed silly to me, but I did it anyway.  Now, although I don't know if it's <i>actually</i> the case, he seems to be a Christian.  I mean, Zwan did cover "Jesus I My Cross Have Taken".  Wouldn't it be nice if everyone you prayed for could be saved?  Eh.. maybe not.  God knows what he's doing better than we do, anyway.
