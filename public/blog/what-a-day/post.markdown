Jessica and I got to see our baby's heartbeat for the first time today!  That was one of the single most awesome things I've experienced; I can't wait to meet the kid.

It was also really reassuring to us.  We're only a few days past the point at which we lost our last baby, and our nerves are often strained with the fearful prospect of losing this one (who is fondly known as Spud).  Not being able to experience any of the physical data of pregnancy first hand, it was doubly reassuring for me to be able to interact with some of those data visually.

All told, I'm really excited to be a dad.
