Amos and I began Monday morning with some iPhone play time.  He managed to flip through every single photo I'd taken on the device, which was really fun for the both of us.

After Nathan went to work, we spent the rest of the day walking around downtown Indy &mdash; we were quite the sight with two preggers and one toddler.

Amos demanded to walk everywhere, which was both cute and difficult: he couldn't cross at streets alone, and that was really frustrating to him.

We stopped in at a toy shop on Massachusetts Ave and had a ton of fun looking at all the things available for kiddos.  Our beautiful dolls played with some Ugly Dolls (which are <b>way</b> cheaper in Indy), and all three families wound up buying one.  Chuckanuka!

Amos rocked out while we played.

We eventually made our way down to a big ol' war monument; apparently, Indy is big on monuments.  It has some direct tie to the planning and development of Washington D.C. and has many, many monuments.  Amos loved walking up the steps.
