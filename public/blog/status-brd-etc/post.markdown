I've completed the beta of Nathaniel's and my <a href="http://students.washington.edu/bribera/brd/">Biblical Reference Database</a>.  It's done in <acronym title="Recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> and MySQL, using valid <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> and valid <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>.  We'll call it version 0.8(b)--I'm still finding some operational flaws.  I don't see any major bugs, but I'm still looking--most of the things I'm catching now are misused tags that cause validation errors.  I think I've eliminated all of them, though.

I'd really like it if people helped us out in building the database.  It would be really easy: whenever you read a book that references the Bible, simply keep a sheet of paper next to you.  After every verse that is referenced, write down the page number and the verse that is referenced on that page.  When you've finished the book, write down the author's name, book title, ISBN, publisher, and publication date, and either <a href="http://students.washington.edu/bribera/brd/?add=new">add</a> them yourself, or email us the information and we'll enter them.  If we can get this thing built up, it will be a really useful tool to any and every one who uses it.

Other news, my room is being cleaned!  Gasp in horror....
