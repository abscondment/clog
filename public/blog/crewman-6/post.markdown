Galaxy Quest is such a great movie.  It's so true to the Star Trek fanclub, and so funny.  OK, confession time: I went to a Star Trek convention when I was younger.  It was before I was 10, when my family still lived in Philadelphia.  But, I remember a lot of it.  Yes, I was a nerd (some would argue saying that stage hasn't quite passsed).  But anyway...  Having seen the way that culture acted, even at such a young age, made me laugh even harder at the convention depicted in Galaxy Quest.  

But I digress.

Apparently, my English grade isn't up because the teacher is investigating some "suspicious-looking" assignments.  Fah.  I want my grade!  Forget those dummy cheaters; give me mine!  Ugh, I'm so impatient.  It was better thinking that there wasn't a valid reason that the grades were delayed; in that case, I could just be pissed.  But now, I have to wait, and like it.
