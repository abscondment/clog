<p>Jessica and my vacation in Texas is drawing to a close.  'twill bring a slew of pictures soon, assuming we manage to hang onto our camera while traveling home.</p>
<p>We've had a ton of fun, and we're really sad to leave her family.  The usual stigma associated with "the inlaws" is a big ol' myth--I'm sad to leave, and I do wish we lived closer to them.  Or they to us, rather... I really like Seattle.</p>
<p>I'll leave with this embarrassing documentation of Jessica's and my holiday passtime: creating "Footie pajama" shirts for the whole gang.</p>
