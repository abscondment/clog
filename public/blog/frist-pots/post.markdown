I really wanted to find a blogging solution that didn't require me to run <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> on my server and was compatible with PostgreSQL. That said, I'm not willing to go back to movable type, and I'm too busy to write something myself. So here I am, back in the land o' Wordpress.
