I'm actually glad to be back in school; in a sick way, I missed having no time on my hands.  Of course I wish that I could be with Jessica; that goes without saying (So, one would ask, why did you just say it?).  Maybe if she had been around during the break I would be more reluctant to go back.  Other than that, I think the learning outweighs the work.

I'm enjoying the <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/373">programming class (CSE 373)</a> that I'm taking right now, as well as the others (<a href="http://staff.washington.edu/ldalley/">English 212</a>, <a href="http://www.stat.washington.edu/murua/stat311/">Statistics 311</a> [enjoying that class the least, currently], and History 209 [this history of Christianity. Quite interesting to hear being taught in a secular context].)  Anyway, I have to go to my statistics class and be bored.  I mean really; how fun could statistics possibly be?
