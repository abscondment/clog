Holst's "Jupiter" from "The Planets" just finished playing.  That music is simply amazing.  I have to write a reading response on <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=1551111802">Jane Eyre</a>... ugh ugh ugh.  I think I'm just going to wake up early tommorow (today) and do it then...  yes, that is what I'll do.

We (the youth group volunteers) got together for dinner at Jessica's today.  It was a lot of fun.  I need to go to sleep.  My apartment manager is blasting music so loud that we can feel bass thumping the floor... and it's 12:25.  Nice.
