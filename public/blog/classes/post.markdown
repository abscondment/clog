I have a pretty full schedule, considering work, my course load, <acronym title="Reformed University Fellowship"><a href="http://www.uw.ruf.org">RUF</a></acronym>, and Youth Group.  But that's OK; I've even been able to get some <a href="http://www.cmfnow.com/product.asp?0=339&amp;1=345&amp;3=8826">light reading</a> done.
