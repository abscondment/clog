I read this today while sitting on the curb behind the HUB, waiting for Jessica to drive by.  It really struck with some things I was thinking about today; especially with the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/sexsipinoy/9872.html?thread=11152#t11152">comment I left on Ricky's LiveJournal</a>.
Jeremiah 17:</p><blockquote><p><sup>5</sup>Thus says the LORD:
"Cursed is the man who trusts in man<br />
   and makes flesh his strength,<br />
   whose heart turns away from the LORD.<br />
<sup>6</sup>He is like a shrub in the desert,<br />
   and shall not see any good come.<br />
He shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness,<br />
   in an uninhabited salt land.<br />
<sup>7</sup>"Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD,<br />
   whose trust is the LORD.<br />
<sup>8</sup>He is like a tree planted by water,<br />
   that sends out its roots by the stream,<br />
and does not fear when heat comes,<br />
   for its leaves remain green,<br />
and is not anxious in the year of drought,<br />
   for it does not cease to bear fruit."<br />
<sup>9</sup>The heart is deceitful above all things,<br />
   and desperately sick;<br />
   who can understand it?<br />
<sup>10</sup>"I the LORD search the heart<br />
   and test the mind,<br />
to give every man according to his ways,<br />
   according to the fruit of his deeds."<br />
<sup>11</sup>Like the partridge that gathers a brood that she did not hatch,<br />
   so is he who gets riches but not by justice;<br />
in the midst of his days they will leave him,<br />
   and at his end he will be a fool.<br />
<sup>12</sup>A glorious throne set on high from the beginning<br />
   is the place of our sanctuary.<br />
<sup>13</sup>O LORD, the hope of Israel,<br />
   all who forsake you shall be put to shame;<br />
those who turn away from you shall be written in the earth,<br />
   for they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living water.</p></blockquote><p>I'm struck again and again with the fact that people are a bunch of messed up losers.  I mean that in the nicest way possible; while we are created in God's image, we certainly don't act the part (or even try to, at times).  Trusting in man, be it another person or one's own strength, will always be unfulfilling--will always leave us dried up and thirsting for more.

Ugh.  I really need to study for my midterm tommorow.... grr.
