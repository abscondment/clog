I remember the days when ...

No, I don't think I can quite start this out like that, since the days I'm remembering were only a year or two ago.  I remember being a <a href="http://www.counter-strike.net">Counter-Strike</a> nerd (and Arctic), complete with "1337" speech (that's pronounced <i>leet</i>, for all you people who aren't in-the-know.  I used to be really good at that game--I'm sure I still am, but I don't really have time for it anymore.

I was just thinking about how ridiculous the shorthand typing I'd do was; I can type this path (and many others) from <a href="http://mud.arctic.org">ArcticMUD</a> in a ridiculously shourt amount of time:
unl door<br />
open door<br />
n<br />
free prisoner<br />
s<br />
e<br />
e<br />
e<br />
d<br />
e<br />
u<br />
w<br />
w<br />
s<br />
e<br />
s<br />
w<br />
w<br />
hol torch<br />
pull lever<br />
rem torch<br />

Wasted hours?  Yes.  No.  Partially.  I can type really fast now, but I'd never start playing again.

I need to go to bed.  Stupid daylight savings time.
