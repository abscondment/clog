Since the DOCTYPE I have been using on this site is labeled "<acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> 1.0 Transitional," I thought it would be appropriate to actually make the transition.

The site is now XHTML 1.1 compliant (with the exception of the pop-up comment posts that are built in to <a href="http://movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>--I'll edit those someday).

I've been working back through old posts, correcting any <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> errors that I may have made (mostly having to do with a use of <tt>&lt;blockquote&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;ul&gt;</tt> that conflicted with Movable Type's auto-line-break paragraph mechanism).  Fun fun.
