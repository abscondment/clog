<p>Translation for all you non-nerds:</p>
<p>This week I'm working at Barnes &amp; Noble, working on the Church website, going to a youth group meeting, hanging out with Jessica, and (hopefully) seeing the <a href="http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/exhibit/exhibitDetail.asp?eventID=5367">Van Gogh exhibit</a> at the <a href="http://seattleartmuseum.org">Seattle Art Museum</a> between church on Sunday.</p>
