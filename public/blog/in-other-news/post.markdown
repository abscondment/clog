As <a href="http://students.washington.edu/bribera/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=150">per request</a>, today's post will be a little spicier.

Last night after Jessica dropped me off I had to battle the flying monkeys from <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0032138/">The Wizard of Oz</a>.  It was a pretty intense battle, but my Ninja skills really helped out.

When I got to the monkey captain, I learned that the Wicked Witch was in league with Darth Vader's mechanical body (which survived his death at the end of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0086190/">Return of the Jedi</a>).  After hours of monkey torture (burning bananas), I managed to extract where the location of their top-secret base was.  With the help of Lionhearted-Luke, Chad-the-aerospace-engineer, and Tin-Man-Dan, I successfully blew up the Death Star.

Needless to say, I was crowned king of France.
