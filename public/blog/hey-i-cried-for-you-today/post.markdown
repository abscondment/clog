how many years on this earth?<br />
rolling, lacerating my heart in glass.<br />
swollen purple bruised wounds<br />
that drip slow through my plastic pen<br />
intravenous, oozing black blood<br />
for hearts blackened by years.<br />
years break my friends, smearing ash in their wounds<br />
and drown my sight in love's tears.<br />
