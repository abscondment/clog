I was recently browsing the internet.  Big surprise, I know.  I came across <a href="http://chiefwiggles.blog-city.com/">The Online Journal of Chief Wiggles</a>, and specifically his <a href="http://chiefwiggles.blog-city.com/read/304431.htm">"About Me" section</a> (found by clicking the "Who is Chief Wiggles?" like on the front page).

I found this site by coincidence; Dan had been looking at <a href="http://instapundit.com">InstaPundit</a> last night, and it was in my head.  Today, I visited <a href="http://jcantonw.blogspot.com/">Phil Stark's Blog</a> (I worked with Phil at Noah's Bagels a while back).  Lo and behold, there was a link to InstaPundit.  So, I clicked it and then decided to read an article that was referenced.

This led me to Chief Wiggles.

I started to read his bio, and I started to get ill:</p><blockquote><p>"I am on a personal quest to find my path, my way in life that leads me to happiness and personal fulfillment, through daily self-improvement, internal discovery, and external contributions."</p></blockquote><p>I read more and I started to get interested:</p><blockquote><p>"I am but one human being, with all the normal weaknesses and imperfections you would expect a man to have, with opportunities for forgiveness through the atonement of Jesus Christ. All of us are part of a divinely inspired plan, all of us with great worth as children of our eternal Father in Heaven who is our companion along this path I speak of."</p></blockquote><p>Then, I figured out what the problem was:</p><blockquote><p>"I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a Mormon and very proud of my ancestors, the pioneers who paid the ultimate price to exercise their right to the freedom of worship. (Just for the record, no Mormons don't have more than one wife and yes we are Christians)"</p></blockquote><p>

Just to re-iterate:</p><blockquote><p>"Just for the record, no Mormons don't have more than one wife and yes we are Christians"</p></blockquote><p>

Here are a few sites outlining the differences.  Reading through them will make the case obvious; Christianity and Mormonism believe very different things about God, salvation, etc.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/mormon/features/christianity.shtml">BBC Religion &amp; Ethics</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/mormon/features/christianityt.shtml">the second page</a>.</li><li><a href="http://www.irr.org/mit/Is-Mormonism-Christian.html">"Mormons in Transition" on this subject</a>.</li><li>And there's also this: <a href="http://calvarychapel.com/library/davis-bob/text/mcoc.htm">Bob Davis - Mormonism: Cult or Christianity?</a> (it's pretty long, and I've only read the beginning)</li></ul><p>Needless to say, Chief Wiggles needs to read up on Mormonism, Christianity, or both.
