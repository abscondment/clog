This morning, while I was cooking breakfast, my wife confronted me about a few things she found in the sink.  <em>"Is this chocolate syrup?  Have you been eating ice cream?"</em>, she cries.

I sheepishly admitted my guilt, explaining that ice cream with chocolate syrup has an invigorating quality that aids the brain when it's trying to solve nonlinear dynamics problems at 2:30 AM.

A few minutes later, the cry went up again: <em>"Did you eat peanut butter on it, too?!"</em>.  "No", I replied, "that's cheese, from the omelet I just made".

Peanut butter.  Cheese.  The appearance of these two foods triggered a distinct memory: the tastiest hypothesis ever posited!  My friend Seth Moore once revealed to me some of his family's food-related wisdom.

The hypothesis goes something like this:
<blockquote><strong><em>Any food can be made to taste better--or at least "as good" as before--by adding either cheese or peanut butter.</em></strong></blockquote>
Now, I thought about this for a long time, and I found it very hard to find an exception.  On the one hand, cheese is extremely versatile.  There are hundreds of types, with a variety of flavors, textures, and scents.  Peanut butter, on the other hand, doesn't have as many faces.  However, it's equally adaptable: it can enhance most sweet foods, and several savory.

I'd love to hear about food to which this rule doesn't apply, if you can think of any.
