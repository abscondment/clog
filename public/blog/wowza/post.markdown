Yesterday wins the "Busiest day yet in my life" award.  Tuesday night I started my 5 page English paper; yesterday morning, I woke up at 7am and finished writing the majority of it.  I then biked up to campus to turn it in at noon, after which I studied for my Computer Science final.  That final was 2 hours long--finishing up at 4:30.  I got home and began writing the final paper for my History of Christianity class.  I finished it at 3am.

This morning, I woke up at 8 to edit (and it was a good thing that I did, considering the awful grammar and punctuation that crept into my tired typing), after which I biked up to campus and turned it in at 10am.

Here are the results of my labor:
