<p>We had a party for Jessica's birthday on Saturday night.  It was a lot of fun, and there are some cool pictures (click on the thumbnails for a full-size image).  Read the rest of this entry to see them.</p>
<p>The party was a blast; we had a lot of fun, and there was one <i>really</i> funny moment:  Jessica was opening the Scott's present to her, which was packaged in a huge box of packing peanuts.  The first thing she pulls out is a pamphlet from Fred Meyer jewelers, titled "How to Take Care of your Diamond" (or something like that).  At this point, everyone starts looking at me in shock, thinking that some sort of proposal is going on.  Jessica turns beet red; I plead innocence and tell everyone I have nothing to do with this.  She takes a box out (which looks like it should contain a ring) of the peanuts, and opens it to reveal some diamond earrings.  We had a good laugh about that (although I wish that I had been able to buy her her first diamond...).</p>
<p>In other news, my dad is freaking out because he has to present his colloquium paper on Tuesday.  He's definately in crunch mode, and I see where I get that "study habit" from.</p>
<p>Now for pictures...</p><blockquote>
