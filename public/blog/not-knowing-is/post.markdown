Not knowing is really annoying.  I've been feeling better, if not totally well, for a little bit.  Then, out of nowhere, my Subway sandwich decided it would rather not be digested--but I've kept everything else down since then.

Grr...

Other news, been trying to beat Halo in my "spare" time (the time I've taken away from school because I haven't been feeling well).  It's a fun game, but the popularity of the multiplayer version is astounding to me.  It's a fluke that will pass, if you ask me; Counter-Strike provides a much better gameplay experience (providing that, unlike me, you have a fast internet connection; and, in that case, providing you can find a server that isn't overrun by little boys).

RUF was great tonight; Ed talked about the way Jonah prayed.
