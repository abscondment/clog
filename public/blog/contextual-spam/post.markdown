Comment spam has <a href="http://jolma.org/blog/?p=276">come up</a> in a few <a href="http://thenullpointer.net/wordpress/spam-and-recaptcha">recent posts</a> by people I know.  I've seen my fair share of this, but I encountered something new today.

My post on <a href="http://threebrothers.org/brendan/blog/articles/2008/02/11/bittorrent-misnomers-and-the-oscars">BitTorrent and the Oscars</a> was recently hit with "Watch the Oscars Online" link spam.  This is the only instance of this type of spam I've seen on my blog &mdash; everything else involves prescription drugs and miscellaneous unmentionable things.

Are spammers jumping on the contextual advertising bandwagon?
