<p>Metallica grows on me every time I listen to it.</p>
<blockquote><p>From "For Whom the Bell Tolls"</p>
<p><i>Take a look to the sky just before you die<br />
It is the last time you will<br />
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky<br />
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry<br />
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery<br />
He hears the silence so loud<br />
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be<br />
Now they will see what will be, blinded eyes to see</i></p></blockquote>
<p>When I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812504798/qid=1086981130/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-3714666-2663826">The Red Badge of Courage</a> in 10<sup>th</sup> grade (11<sup>th</sup>? I can't remember...), I hated it.  I think I hated it because it had nothing to say.  This point is illustrated in the fact that the Metallica song quoted above sums the whole book up, puts it to rockin' music, and shortens the ordeal rather nicely.</p>
<p>Boo, red badge,  boo!</p>
