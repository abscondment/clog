I've started trying out <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/">Mozilla Firebird 0.7</a>, which is supposed to be even better than <a href="http://mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla</a> itself.  It's pretty good so far; and it is a lot faster.  I haven't seen any rendering problems or mis-implemented <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> bugs... I'll give my approval before too long, I'm sure.  Ooh... it just failed to connect to Arctic.  Or maybe that's just a failure in their applet.   The latter is probably true.

Anyway... been rotating AVL Trees all week.  BORING!
