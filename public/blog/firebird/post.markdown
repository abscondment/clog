I've started trying out <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/">Mozilla Firebird 0.7</a>, which is supposed to be even better than <a href="http://mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/">Mozilla</a> itself.  It's pretty good so far; and it is a lot faster.  I haven't seen any rendering problems or mis-implemented <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> bugs... I'll give my approval before too long, I'm sure.  Ooh... it just failed to connect to Arctic.  Or maybe that's just a failure in their applet.   The latter is probably true.

Anyway...

Been rotating AVL Trees all week.  BORING!"Hurt" by Nine Inch Nails</p><blockquote><p>I hurt myself today<br />
to see if I still feel<br />
I focus on the pain<br />
the only thing that's real<br />
the needle tears a hole<br />
the old familiar sting<br />
try to kill it all away<br />
but I remember everything<br />
what have I become?<br />
my sweetest friend<br />
everyone I know<br />
goes away in the end<br />
you could have it all<br />
my empire of dirt<br />
I will let you down<br />
I will make you hurt<br />
I wear my crown of shit<br />
on my liar's chair<br />
full of broken thoughts<br />
I cannot repair<br />
beneath the stain of time<br />
the feeling disappears<br />
you are someone else<br />
I am still right here<br />
what have I become?<br />
my sweetest friend<br />
everyone I know<br />
goes away in the end<br />
you could have it all<br />
my empire of dirt<br />
I will let you down<br />
I will make you hurt<br />
if I could start again<br />
a million miles away<br />
I would keep myself<br />
I would find a way</p></blockquote><p>"I will let you down / I will make you hurt" -- there's a lot of truth in that.  People's relationships are fallen just as much as the rest of the world; we hurt eachother all the time.  At <a href="http://students.washington.edu/ruf/"><acronym title="Reformed University Fellowship">RUF</acronym></a>, our campus minister is doing four weeks on relationships (not only of the romantic nature); last night's message was great.
