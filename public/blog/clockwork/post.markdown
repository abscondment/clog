Last night (clarification: last night was Thursday, the 6th... it's 12:48 on Saturday, so it's still "Friday" in my mind) we (Luke Brodine, Jessica and I) were going to watch A Clockwork Orange.  None of us had seen it before.  We still haven't seen it:

Five or ten minutes into the movie, we decided that there was no way it could redeem itself; the movie is straight up twisted.  Beatings, rape, etc.  There's nothing good in it--and I don't care if it has a "message".  There are other ways to say the same thing; the things that movie does can't justify things it presents.
