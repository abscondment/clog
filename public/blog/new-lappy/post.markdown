Remember the joyful glee of discovering that Strong Bad had purchased a new laptop?  I am experiencing such glee right now--I have a new laptop of my own.

I bought a Sony VAIO VGN-C190P this evening; it's already running a copy of <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> flawlessly.  Some specifications:
<ul>
	<li>Core 2 Duo T7200 (that's the one with the 4<acronym title="Megabyte">MB</acronym> <acronym title="Level 2">L2</acronym> Cache)</li>
	<li>1 <acronym title="Gigabyte">GB</acronym> DDR2</li>
	<li>120 GB hard drive</li>
	<li>5 lbs</li>
</ul>
I'm quite happy; my former laptop has a battery life of ~10 minutes.  This one, 3-4 hours.
