Nothing original from me today.  Skipping English.  Yeah.


"Two promises" - Sunny Day Real Estate

long days caught in his room<br />
trapped in the gloom of the dying light<br />
his heart pleads through the wounds that he bleeds<br />
the wounds he never can close<br />
wrong way mind in a haze<br />
never know what he could do<br />
he thinks i gave her my heart she tasted my soul<br />
now she's gone again<br />
he thinks i gave her my heart she tasted my blood<br />
now she's gone again

long days alone with his shame<br />
fanning the flames of desire<br />
his heart breaks as his memory plays<br />
images of her betrayal<br />
wrong way his mind in a rage<br />
never know what he could do<br />
he thinks i gave her my heart she tasted my soul<br />
now she's gone again<br />
he thinks i gave her my heart she tasted my blood<br />
now she's gone again

why did you leave me here?<br />
how could you lead me down here?

he can't decide where to go then<br />
two promises one imperfect<br />
walls he's building keep on crumbling down<br />
walls are falling try to keep them sound

long days he thinks the time will be soon<br />
pacing his room with his dark thoughts<br />
his heart breaks at the road he must take<br />
the road that will lead to the end<br />
wrong way he thinks it's right for release<br />
he'll never know peace in his lifetime<br />
he thinks i gave her my heart she tasted my soul<br />
now she's gone again<br />
he thinks i gave her my heart she tasted my blood<br />
now she's gone again

he can't decide where to go then<br />
two promises are imperfect<br />
walls he's building keep on crumbling down<br />
walls have fallen now there is no sound
