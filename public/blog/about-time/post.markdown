Well, for a minute there I thought that my English paper was going to be graded and the score for that class submitted before my Philosophy grade was up.  But, they redeemed themselves (they being the Philosophy peoples), although only sorta--I got a 3.9, not the 4.0 I had hoped for.  Wah, wah.  I'm kidding, though; I'm really happy about that grade.  Now I just have to wait and see what I got on my English paper, and then what I got in that class.


I've been reading through Jeremiah, and the first verse I have listed below reminded me of Pastor Kelly's "Gospel of the Wound" Sermons (<a href="http://echo.greenlakepc.org:8080/ramgen/overflow/RM/glpc_jan62002_am.rm?rpurl=http://echo.greenlakepc.org/sermons.php3&amp;rpurlparams=series=&amp;rpcontexturl=http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible&amp;rpcontextparams=Jeremiah%2030:12-17">first</a>, <a href="http://echo.greenlakepc.org:8080/ramgen/glpc/glpc_jan072002_am.rm?rpurl=http://echo.greenlakepc.org/sermons.php3&amp;rpurlparams=series=&amp;rpcontexturl=http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible&amp;rpcontextparams=Jeremiah%2030:12-17">second</a>).
Also, talks I've been having with some friends have centered around pain and God's involvement in it and our lives.  These verses speak to those issues, and I thought I'd post them:


Since my people are crushed, I am crushed;<br />
I mourn, and horror grips me.<br />
Is there no balm in Gilead?<br />
Is there no physician there?<br />
Why then is there no healing<br />
for the wound of my people?<br />

Jeremiah 8:21-22</p><hr style="border-style: solid; width: 60%;" /><p>Come, let us return to the LORD.<br />
He has torn us to pieces<br />
but he will heal us;<br />
he has injured us<br />
but he will bind up our wounds.<br />

Hosea 6:1</p><hr style="border-style: solid; width: 60%;" /><p>This is what the LORD says:

"Your wound is incurable,<br />
your injury beyond healing.<br />
There is no one to plead your cause,<br />
no remedy for your sore,<br />
no healing for you.<br />
...<br />
I have struck you as an enemy would<br />
and punished you as would the cruel,<br />
because your guilt is so great<br />
and your sins so many.<br />
...<br />
But I will restore you to health<br />
and heal your wounds,"<br />
declares the LORD.<br />

Jeremiah 30:12-14, 18</p><hr style="border-style: solid; width: 60%;" /><p>

The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days, when the LORD binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted.

Isaiah 30:26
