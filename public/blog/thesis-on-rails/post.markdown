Found an interesting research project documenting the <a href="http://thesis.cicaboo.com">adoption motivations and practices</a> among companies that are using Rails.

The top responses about companies' motivations, rails' features, and the companies' perceptions are, respectively:

<ol>
  <li>that companies desired "Increase[s] in productivity" (97.9%)</li>
  <li>that Rails is attractive because it uses the Model-View-Controller framework (87.7%)</li>
  <li>that Rails enables faster development of web applications than competing frameworks (92.5%)</li>
</ol>
