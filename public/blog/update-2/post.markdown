<p>Wow... I haven't updated in a while.  Let's change that... what's going on?</p>
<p>I'm going to be working more at Barnes &amp; Noble.  I'm being trained today to work in receiving / shelving, and that will up the number of hours I get every week (at least for the rest of the summer).  That's good--more money!</p>
<p>Jessica, Bethane, and Kristin got an apartment.  It's good and cheap, a rare combination.</p>
<p>I've been working on a Tic Tac Toe AI: I'm trying to perfect one that only looks two moves deep and is unbeatable without programming in actual board scenarios.  So yeah... I'm close, but no cigar.  I have to tweak the way I'm valuing differnt boards.</p>
<p>That's about it...</p>
