<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/kid_quantum/">Ryan</a> and I engaged in a deep philosophical debate the other day.  We related life to the different disciplines we're studying; I think it was pretty successful.  Part of the transcript is posted below for your amusement:

<blockquote><p>
abscondment (8:37:30 PM): i pity the foo who don't like english.<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:37:34 PM): you pity me!<br />
abscondment (8:37:36 PM): hehe<br />
abscondment (8:37:45 PM): why don't you like english?<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:38:00 PM): some things just don't have a logical explanation, they just are<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:38:10 PM): plus i hate reading<br />
abscondment (8:38:13 PM): in english, you mean? or relating to your dislike?<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:38:23 PM): relating to my dislike lol<br />
abscondment (8:38:30 PM): hehe<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:38:32 PM): english, there's no right or wrong answers<br />
abscondment (8:38:58 PM): hmm<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:39:01 PM): there's "mostly right" "partly right" and "not very right"<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:39:27 PM): and that's based on whatever your particular teacher thinks<br />
abscondment (8:39:29 PM): there's a "definately not right" category<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:39:46 PM): i guess it depends on the question<br />
abscondment (8:39:51 PM): and a, "oh, i didn't think of that... hmmm"<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:39:56 PM): "what is this book a metaphor for?"<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:40:00 PM): you CANT be wrong<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:40:04 PM): you could say anything<br />
abscondment (8:40:07 PM): yeah, but you can be stupid.<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:40:13 PM): haha yeah<br />
abscondment (8:40:46 PM): but what is life more alike to? programming, or english?<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:40:55 PM): my life is more like programming<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:41:14 PM): logical, planned, drama-free<br />
abscondment (8:41:36 PM): heh<br />
abscondment (8:42:16 PM): it's planned, but you can't control it the way you control a program<br />
abscondment (8:42:23 PM): what if martians land?<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:42:27 PM): see<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:42:31 PM): programs are also planned<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:42:37 PM): but can still do unexpected things<br />
abscondment (8:42:43 PM): that's just poor planning<br />
abscondment (8:42:49 PM): the best life planning can go awry<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:42:50 PM): cuz they might depend on lots of stuff you didn't know about<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:43:09 PM): granted it's not EXACTLY like life<br />
abscondment (8:43:12 PM): hehe<br />
abscondment (8:43:18 PM): well, neither is english<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:43:26 PM): ok so<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:43:28 PM): it's a mix<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:43:41 PM): and the decision is on the percentages of each<br />
abscondment (8:43:47 PM): hehe<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:43:55 PM): so i'd say 80 % programming 20% english<br />
abscondment (8:44:02 PM): that probably varies depending on disposition, etc<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:44:10 PM): yeah i mean for me<br />
abscondment (8:44:12 PM): yeah<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:44:17 PM): people that have like... actual lives<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:44:19 PM): might be more like english<br />
abscondment (8:44:26 PM): recommendation: don't read 19th c. british lit.<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:44:35 PM): really REALLY wasn't planning on it<br />
abscondment (8:44:42 PM): hah<br />
abscondment (8:44:58 PM): death is 80% 19th c. british lit<br />
abscondment (8:45:03 PM): and 20% programming errors<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:45:13 PM): LOL<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:45:20 PM): more like a run-time crash<br />
abscondment (8:45:48 PM): yeah, errors that come out after runtime are more like midlife crises<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:46:00 PM): heh<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:46:06 PM): birth defects = compiler error<br />
abscondment (8:46:09 PM): lol<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:46:40 PM): all the other kids hate you = linker error<br />
abscondment (8:47:00 PM): lol<br />
abscondment (8:47:18 PM): gender change = port to another language<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:47:22 PM): haha<br />
abscondment (8:47:28 PM): hehe<br />
KidQuantum7 (8:47:31 PM): risky<br />
abscondment (8:47:45 PM): seriously</p>

And I was serious about that death thing.  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=1551111691">Mary Barton</a> is one of the most boring books I have ever read.  Not to mention the fact that the editor (who is a doctoral candidate at the University of Ottowa) added <i>more</i> mistakes than previously existed in the text.  Thanks, thanks a lot.
