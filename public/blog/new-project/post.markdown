I've undertaken a new programming project for the break.  Whenever I play Clue, I hate having to keep track of everything on that little scrap of paper--there's just not enough space for all the notes I want to keep.  So, I've decided to write a program that will track the game for me and spit out the correct solution as soon as it's logically possible to discern.

I know, this isn't <i>that</i> cool, but I think it's pretty fun.
