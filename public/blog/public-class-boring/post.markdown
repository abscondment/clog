So, the whole implementation of that <acronym title="Binary Search Tree">BST</acronym> to Linked List method can be found in the following files:</p><ul><li><a href="http://students.washington.edu/bribera/java/BinaryNode.java">BinaryNode.java</a>:
Node in the BST</li><li><a href="http://students.washington.edu/bribera/java/BinarySearchTree.java">BinarySearchTree.java</a>:
Class containing methods to perform operations on BSTs comprised of BinaryNodes (doesn't have delete implemented yet...)</li><li><a href="http://students.washington.edu/bribera/java/Link.java">Link.java</a>:
Simple implementation of a Linked List.</li><li><a href="http://students.washington.edu/bribera/java/Bst.java">Bst.java</a>:
Class containing main method; creates a few BSTs, instatiates BinarySearchTree and runs some operations using it, demonstrates conversion of BST to Linked List (note: don't set <code>num</code> too high on this; as I said before, the coversion method is a <i>huge</i> memory hog and it'll crash if you do).</li></ul><p>Other news, finishing the last 2 problems of my statistics homework... now.
