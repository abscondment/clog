Jessica and I met at 7:00 this morning to read the Bible at <a href="http://www.zokacoffee.com">Zoka</a>.  Since the <a href="http://students.washington.edu/ruf/">RUF</a> leadership meeting was moved to Thursday mornings, we're going to do that every week.

School is going very well.  I have a lot of reading to do, but I'm actually enjoying going to class.  I was supposed to see Ricky today and get a Starcraft CD from him, but we didn't connect ... Ricky!  I want CD! (Chris said you weren't even in the Archaeology class today... I guess I'll just get a copy of his on Monday).

Presbytery happened/is happening today.  Kevin VandenBrink passed his final ordination exams--yay!  Mmmm... stupid work.  I don't want to go to work.

I've had a line from a <a href="http://www.damienjurado.com/">Damien Jurado</a> song stuck in my head all day, and it promped me to post the last half of the song (called "Tonight I will Retire"):


And if I should taste fire<br />
Save me not, I deserve to die

And oh tonight I will retire<br />
To loving arms of my savior<br />
And we will walk through his gates<br />
To the skies of Heaven

And no more tears will I cry<br />
Are my sins, are they forgiven

And if I should taste fire<br />
Save me not, I deserve to die
