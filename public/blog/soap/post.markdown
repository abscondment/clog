So, I'm finally going to use some SOAP.  Now, for all of you who have no idea what SOAP is, this probably sounds like a ridiculous joke--yes, I do shower.  In fact, I have showered for some time... so bug off!

Seriously, though.  SOAP is an amazing application of XML that allows messageing between various programs.  Really quite cool.  I'm loading Jakarta Tomcat, Apache SOAP, and Apache Xerxes on my laptop for testing.  Fun, fun, fun!

Leaving tommorow for the RUF retreat.  I'm going to miss Jessica a whole lot....
