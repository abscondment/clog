So, I uncovered a little security issue at the <a href="http://go.vicinity.com/bnobleinc/mapPrx.d?E=sMDd7h_PUbUTdo9RmlKWYzTRrRmaU05znsnAeo2om7R6jNKUsxmmjWjM0r8qpDx6ebxw9pHTVDpKojw6TPh4ddKnjCv3qa-FSHj083jh7xMkiR5yJTf_aSo10qegNFR9_83jh6peF6vPUZwf10qe6HXTgpIgK9dOHHO59yx10scuzGDX-OdyQe7XSkJlDrpSuEum4fSlr8QqZ6ajxhKjXTJYJkUUddJdrFeumiTir_WQtyGeulOK0nAZ66bxOc4qkPHp5vHD2unkW4_nHo3ZUcayjGNPXTX8wddD9DF8_OuM9dNsJKF7BD9DBKvScFUDPXTFZBmL58dewz10up4mZx10-XMx10-aTuo9I66c_HSO1RB2q_jr2bnOcdPzjshz7f8_BuLcY9kXU1Q7z8PHHee6quuceHfpa5x4d4yyPGHeMsj0BxcZljyJFS8L1eeeozMveMsj3QxWVuOq4eOO4_c_ZYdx8XZpdMgduqh25zMdu4S6ao7jw7dSd1HpHbrh27NznOO3Z8UnksHbs_KT0VOQOpdx6XHh">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> store I work at.  I won't go into specifics until the hole is actually plugged, but this basically allowed a person access (write access, in most cases) to networked computers within and without the store, as well as a lot of control over the individual workstation.  I mean, I installed hearts on one of the information desk computers and wrote a file to the in store intranet server while one of my managers watched--and it took me less than 1 minute.  I explained the whole process of bypassing the current security measures to one of their tech guys over the phone; hopefully they'll fix it soon so I can feel OK posting what was actually goin' on (or not--might be fun to play hearts at work *wink wink*).

Other news, I have recently soared to 15<sup>th</sup> place in <a href="http://www.teragaia.com">Teragaia</a>.  Yay, go me.

My genius <acronym title="Computer Science &amp; Engineering">CSE</acronym> <acronym title="Teaching Assistant">TA</acronym> tried to make a <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse373/CurrentQtr/assignments.htm">turnin page</a> for our <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse373/CurrentQtr/homework/proj1.html">first project</a>.  Wait, wait--it doesn't work!  Us non-majors (and this is a non-major only class) can't access either this command or the mentioned server.  D'oh.

Also, I've decided that it would be good if we could implement some <a href="http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/d.html#death_code">death code</a> for customers who don't answer the questions they're asked.  It's not like they have anything more in that head, anyway.
