<a href="http://jeskybera.blogspot.com">Jessica</a> is pregnant again!  She's approximately 7 weeks along, which means we just passed the point at which we lost the first one.  Things seem to be going very well; in fact, I'd say that she's one of the happiest victims of <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/morningsickness.html">Morning sickness</a> to date.

We've been having a lot of fun <a href="http://jeskybera.blogspot.com/2007/11/spuds-favorite-foods-part-i.html">preparing food suited for pregnancy</a> &mdash; I have seen more kale consumed in the past weeks than I have during the rest of my life &mdash; but the best part is flipping (with eager anticipation) through the copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Child-Born-Lennart-Nilsson/dp/0385337558">A Child is Born</a> that Jessica bought.  That book has some <em>amazing</em> pictures of children's in utero development (I describe one of my favorites as "a fried wonton filled with caviar").

Anyway, I just thought I'd share the incredible news.
