<p>Wrote this in about 2 minutes during my last Informatics class before the final.  Was I paying attention?  Nah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>untitled</p>
<p>plant something beautiful<br />
inside this barren heart<br />
crack leaden walls with the<br />
pressure of its strong root<br />
give ears that we may hear<br />
the singing of your voice<br />
give eyes that we may see<br />
and follow after you<br />
remove this chill grey mist<br />
and kindle the warm day</p>

<p>For some reason I've always liked the color <span style="background-color: #666;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> spelled <i>grey</i> instead of <i>gray</i>.  Spelling it with the e makes me think of a misty morning at the seashore, the kind of day that turns my eyes grey like the sky.  Gray just sounds dumb.</p>
