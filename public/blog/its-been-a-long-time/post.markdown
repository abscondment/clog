<p>I haven't updated in a really long time.  That's OK though; I'm pretty busy.  Just the brief summary for now:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm moving into a new apartment soon.  It's a 1200sqft 2 bedroom; my roommates and I are rather happy about it.</li>
<li>I'm still working on the church website.  It's a really big, really satisfying project.  It's nice to be building it with Megan because it has made me realize that I'd like working on a hugh project as part of a team where something more than whims of mine go into decision making.  Not that my whims are bad--mistakes and stupid ideas are caught much earlier on this way.</li>
<li>I can't wait to back to school still.  Ho hum.</li>
<li>I've stared a second job with a chemistry professor.  He's a really neat guy.</li>
</ul>
