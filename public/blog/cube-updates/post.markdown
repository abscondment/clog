I've been practicing solving Rubik's cube for a while now.  I can generally get it done in under 4 minutes now, with my record being 2 minutes 25 seconds.  I saw a big boost in speed when I switched from the small key-chain cube that I had been using (and that subsequently broke from overuse) to a regular, full-sized cube.

Naturally, Rubik's cat is not quite so well known as his cube.</div>

I hope to shave even more time off my total as I break the cube in and as my muscle memory solidifies.  My goal is to average solving in under two minutes.

<b>Update:</b> I managed to solve a cube in 2 minutes and 7 seconds on the way home after writing this post.  1 minute 45, here I come!
