It's coming soon: <a href="http://thethreadseattle.org">The Thread</a> will present its first Art Night on May 12, 2007.

Pass this along to any artistically inclined friends who might be interested in showing their work.  There's an open <a href="http://thethreadseattle.org/art/submit">call for entries</a>, so have at it!
