The death cab concert was great--they're really fun.  Unfortunately, now I have a midterm (in roughly 1.5 hours).  After that, I get to go to work... yay, woohoo, what a pleasure.  No really, it's joy unspeakable!

So I lie.

3-11:30 is a long time to be at Barnes &amp; Noble; at least I'll get some reading done.

The organ of Corti is inside the cochlea.  It contains the basilar membrane and the tectorial membrane, which facilitate the transduction of sound.

NMDA receptors are required for the existance of LTP, but are not necessary for maintaining it.  Receptors for glutamate can be NMDA or non-NMDA; in fact: Glutamate is normally blocked from NMDA receptors by Mg<sup>++</sup>.  It must first depolarize and repel the Mg<sup>++</sup> by activating the non-NMDA receptors.  After that, it can open the NMDA ones, letting Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>++</sup> in.  Calcium induces celluar change; temporary gene alteration &amp; proteins which alter dendrites &amp; potentiates synapse.  Changes in this post-synaptic cell can be transferred to the pre-synaptic cell via nitric oxide (soluable gas).

Whew.  Hope I remember everything else I need to know.
