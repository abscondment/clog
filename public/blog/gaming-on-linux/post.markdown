Is it a dream?  Is it a lie?  I think I'll let you decide.

That's right--I'm currently installing Counter-Strike <em>under Linux</em>.  Granted, my desktop computer is probably too slow for this to be really playable... but when I upgrade it in a year or two, I'll be set.

Of course, I'd much rather play native binaries.  I'd love to work on creating a Linux-based console.  I think open source software could provide a great platform for gaming.   Aside from being free of <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/dev/tools.htm">restrictive <acronym title="Non-Disclosure Agreement">NDA</acronym>s</a> that are typically associated with proprietary platforms, an open source platform would allow for <em>complete</em> control on the part of the game designer.  Who knows if that will ever happen, though.
