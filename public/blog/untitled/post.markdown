fading, dead light frozen in the mirror;<br />
dust camped upon the window where we sat;<br />
the cracked leather of years upon my face.<br />
wishes destroyed; lost, all bases of truth.<br />
structure, order: what are these foreign things?<br />
the mirror bleeds mercury as I cry.<br />
time explodes; its fragments, needle sharp shards.<br />
can we sift through the broken hour-glass<br />
pull its deep set shrapnel out from your soul?<br />
you cry aloud: their rot still taints your core.<br />

when will you comfort your people, oh Lord?
