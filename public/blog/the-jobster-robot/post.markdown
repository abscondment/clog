The <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2007/08/more-features-r.html">recent Jobster release</a> contains some really interesting features.  One of them&mdash;<a href="http://www.jobster.com/people/robot">The Jobster Robot</a>&mdash;uses the automated tagging software that I developed to suggest skills based on a user's Facebook work experience and college major.

Here's a sample of the output it gives based on my Facebook profile:

Pretty good, considering the paucity of job-related data in Facebook profiles.
