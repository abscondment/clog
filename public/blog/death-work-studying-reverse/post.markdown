Studying:

Tommorow is going to start out with some high-gear studying.  (by tommorow I mean today--note that it's 12:25am as I write, so I haven't slept yet and it still feels like the 20<sup>th</sup> to me.)  That's right--and <a href="http://courses.washington.edu/psy222/">biopsychology</a> is my topic of choice.  Well, I chose it... but the fact that I am studying is because the professor chose to have a midterm on Monday.

Work:

After I study, I have to go to work.  5-11:30pm.  Eewwww.  Plus, Jessica is out of town, so I'll have to have my parents pick me up.  This means I'll be staying over at their house, studying all Saturday morning, taking my youngest brother to a concert (see below), staying Saturday night, and having them drop me off after church.

Death:

As in <a href="http://www.barsuk.com/web.cgi?dcfc&amp;dcfcnews">death cab for cutie</a>.  I'm taking Mark, my youngest brother to see them Saturday night at the Showbox.  Should be a blast... show starts at 6pm with Nada Surf and Smoosh.  I'm pretty excited about it... too bad Jessica had to go to her friend's wedding!


All this to say, I probably won't be posting again until Sunday, at least.  And, Jessica comes home on Sunday--so I might not get a chance to post then, either.
