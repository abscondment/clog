<p>Ever seen an electrical fire?  They're pretty freaky.  Allow me to set the scene...</p>
<p>Jessica and I had just arrived at my apartment after eating dinner with out-of-town and in-town family at Beppos; she was putting a load of laundry into the dryer and I had gone to change into shorts.  I'm in my room half changed and I hear, "Brendan!  Brendan!  Something just caught on fire!  Brendan!  Get out here!"</p>
<p>So naturally, I almost fall over trying to get my pants back on.  I come out and there is a rather acrid smell in the air; Jessica looks like she's seen a ghost.  She points at the charred outlet on the wall--"That just caught on fire!" she says.  I ponder and then unplug my stereo from this outlet.  The circuit breaker is in our kitchen, so after opening a few windows I open it up.  Sure enough, the breaker labeled "Basement Lights" is thrown (the lights are off, I now notice).  I try turning it back on.  The wall sizzles and catches fire a little.  I turn it off, and the fire goes out.  I frown.</p>
<p>So Dan is going to talk to Doug today about our wiring--good thing the house didn't burn down... And I don't think this is what Doug had in mind when he mentioned possibly installing a fireplace in the living room.</p>
<p>Other news, my work for Professor Zoller is going very well.  I really want to get some money.  That's all--Brendan out.
