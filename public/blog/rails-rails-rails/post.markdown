The first week of my trial-by-fire <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> development has come to a close.  And, I still love Rails.

I love the <em>concept</em> of Rails more, now having worked with it for a little--all development should be this easy!  I think by far the most effective principle espoused by the Rails community is <acronym title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</acronym>: Don't Repeat Yourself.  I can't say enough (pun intended) how helpful this maxim is.

I'm often perplexed by the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=FactoryFactory">ways some people apply Java</a>.  A FactoryFactory?  <em>Puh-lease</em>.  This type of software engineering philosophy has been <a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/humor/eecs-difference-explained">denounced satirically</a> at its logical extreme, but Rails is actually incredibly practical.  It tries to make useful things invisible yet accessible, rather than providing a maze of abstraction that deviates from the desired goal.

Plus, the community <a href="http://sqlonrails.org">knows how to make fun</a> of itself.
