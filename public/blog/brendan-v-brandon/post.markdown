<p>I've got a bone to pick with parents.  Stop naming your kids Brandon.</p>
<p>90210 is over.  Most of the Brandons I have met are jerks.  Nobody ever calls a Brandon "Brendan", but I get called "Brandon" all the time.  According to the <a href="http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/namesearch.html">U.S. census name search</a>, "Brandon" is the 68<sup>th</sup> most popular name for boys.  "Brendan" is number 482.  Names like "Franklin", "Clarence", "Gilbert", and "Theodore" rank far higher.</p>
<p>What is going on, I ask?  There are more people named "Jeremiah" than "Brendan"!  Would anyone be able to guess that?  No--because the name "Brandon" has (like redrot in brass) parasitically stolen the dignity, popularity, and tenure of "Brendan".  Thankfully, weird, twisted approximations of the two (i.e., "Brendon" and "Branden") are far down in the ranks.</p>
<p>In response to this, I believe the Pope has declared that naming a child "Brendan" will absolve you or up to three deceased relatives of six <a href="http://www.googol.com/goog_def.htm">googol</a> milliseconds in purgatory.  Being on the wrong side of this battle, however, is now officially the 8<sup>th</sup> deadly sin.</p>
