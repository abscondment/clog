Step out of line, the man comes and takes you away.

A recent <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,62468,00.html">post on Wired News</a> relates some interesting technology developments: the possibility of chips the size of a grain of sand that are embedded into products and track the movement of that product--say, a pair of shoes.  Hello, invasion of privacy.  But, I also think that if one's private life is perfectly legal and not reprehensible, then one has nothing to worry about no matter how much of it is known.  I had a woman buying more than $200 worth of books at Barnes &amp; Noble who didn't want to purchase our discount card (10% off for $25/year, something only book addicts like her would save money on) on the grounds <i>that she didn't want the list of books she bought to be available for subpoena</i>.  I can't understand that.  What kind of books could she be buying?  (They were almost entirely interior design/gardening books)  What a kook.

This touchces on the issue of police conduct:
If a police officer discovers evidence against a person illegally (i.e., while in someone's house without a search warrant), why is that evidence thrown out?  Frankly, I am glad when true criminals are caught--even if some privacy rights are bruised.  I do think, however, that those rights serve a good and necessary purpose--the <i>innocent</i> should be protected.  There need to be actual punishments for police officers who violate those rights, rather than a mere slap on the wrist and the evidence found by the violation being dismissed.
