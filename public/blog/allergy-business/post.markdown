I'm incredibly tired.  This was one loooong leap day.  Jessica picked me up at 7:30 so we could go to QFC, buy salad stuff, make the salad at my apartment, and get to church for an 8:30 youth group meeting.  Then we did youth group, nursery, a youth group parent's meeting, and more youth group.  I'm feeling really allergy-ish right now, so my itching eyes and stuffed up nose didn't help anything.

Now I'm sitting at home, drinking tea and listening to <a href="http://music.barnesandnoble.com/search/product.asp?WRK=383158">Elliott Smith's <i>XO</i></a>.  My roommates and I are meeting at 11:30 to pray; I'm happy about that.

I really, really don't want to go to school tomorrow.  I should have Mary Barton read; I have less than half of it done.  Oh well, it's not a big deal.
