We took leave of the Partains on Thursday and had a little road trip down to Tennessee.  Jessica and I made a two-CD mix for the drive down, although the trip lasted a big longer than that.  I blame the pregnant ladies and their bathroom breaks.

Below is the Meeksarosa off in the distance.  We spent a few nights sitting out on the porch, smoking pipes and chatting late into the night.  Jessica and I even did a <em>Turky in the Straw</em> performance, accompanied by Kenny and his mandolin.

This is us in Franklin, trying to figure out what we're going to do next.  Sorry that you're blinking, Jessica &mdash; this was the best of several candid shots by Kenny that got progressively worse as his cameraman antics increased.

Friday, Saturday and Sunday seemed to fly by, and we totally forgot to take any pictures on those days.  Lame, I know.  We spent those days playing lots of paper telephone, tricking people with talking computers, and sauntering around various shopping centers.

Monday rolled around too quickly, and we had to catch our flight home.  But not before having brunch out with Beth &amp; Dan, and taking the really awesome group photo pictured below.

We posed for a final picture before heading out to the airport.  It's nice that we'll be able to see our friends again so soon (Dan in early May, and everyone in the summer), but it's really lame that we're so far apart.  I really need someone to invent a working teleporter, and soon.

We were definitely sad to leave our friends.  Like I said in the <a href="http://threebrothers.org/brendan/blog/articles/2008/04/19/indyennessee-trip-wednesday-thursday">last Indyennessee post</a>, I hate goodbyes.
