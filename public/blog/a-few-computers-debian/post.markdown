I'm downloading <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> in <a href="http://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/">ISO form</a>.  I really want to get a few older computers--400-500 mHz desktops with ~20GB of disk space--and build myself a <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/beowulf/">Beowulf Cluster</a> (see <a href="http://www.ubergeek.tv/switchlinux/">alternate description</a>).  So, I'm looking at eBay.  It would be pretty cool to get a nice cluster running.  If I had a ton of money I'd (note: if I had a bunch of money, I'd get married first) buy myself 20 brand new computers and have an awesome little web serving business.

Speaking of web businesses, I have recently started working on two plans for this summer.
I recently made a website for my friends Luke and Karen, who are going to be married this July.  It took me almost no time to do, and it was actually pretty fun--making a realy site is more satisfying than just working on this one for myself.
The second idea was the result of a discussion Nathaniel Thompson and I had yesterday.  He came over for dinner (I made some <a href="http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/recipe.asp?rid=32905">Moroccan chicken with olives</a>), and we were talking about reading books (going over the <a href="http://www.wts.edu/admissions/readlist.html">Westminster suggested reading list</a> and commenting on how fun it would be to read all of those books).  Nathaniel then related that he had been wishing that there was some way to check references relating to specific Bible verses.  The example he gave was when reading a passage, one might think, "I remember Lewis or someone writing something really cool about this... where can I find it?"  Nathaniel had started recording any such references that he encountered while doing the <acronym title="Reformed University Fellowship">RUF</acronym> reading in an Excel spreadsheet.  I of course, heard "WEBSITE" screaming throughout this... so we're building one.  Users will be able to browse the books of the Bible and see the entries associated with specific verses.  There will be some moderated process by which users can also submit references.  Users will be able to search by author--results will list books, and clicking on individual books will display all of the entries associated with that book.

I think it would be really cool if we could get a bunch of pastors / other people who read books to contribute references to this.  It would be an incredible resource, and by doing an associate program with amazon.com or bn.com, it could probably generate enough revenue to support itself.
