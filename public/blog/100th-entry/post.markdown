Yes, this is the 100<sup>th</sup> entry on my blog.  Time to celebrate.<br /><br />

So yeah.  I've already figured out which of my classes I am going to like, how much I will like each of them, and for what reasons.  Here goes:
<ol><li>C LIT 211: A Comparative Literature class focusing on Dickens and Dostoevsky.  We're reading <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0141439564">Great Expectations</a> and <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0451527348">The Brothers Karamazov</a>.<br />
This week we're also watching <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0033870/">The Maltese Falcon</a> to have a modern day thing with which to compare the dramatic style in both the novels.</li><li>INFO 311:  This class is going to be really, really interesting.  A close second to the CompLit class.  Studying information issues within society, such as privacy, copyright laws, information system design, <i>et cetera</i>.  Should be really fun.</li><li><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse410/04sp/">CSE 410</a>:  This class is almost as fun as the first two, only I think it will be a little harder than both of them.  Learning about the hardware/software interface of computers--some <a href="http://www.xploiter.com/mirrors/asm/asm_1.htm">assembly programming</a> and operating system concepts.  Fun, but some work.</li><li>ENGL 242:  The real reason I decided to write these things out.  I'm not too excited about my English class.  My teacher has the sort of look that pegs her to be a crazy liberal post-modern relativist; after the first class I felt that this previously unsupported judgement was almost supported.
<br /><br />
I'm just going to transcribe some of the side-notes I took during the class (mainly thoughts I was having about what she was saying):
<ul><li>(<i>the class is about the concept of Home in America.  She said she chose this because Americans are obsessed with "Home"--as evidenced by the popularity of TV shows such as <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/Queer_Eye_for_the_Straight_Guy/">Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</a> and <a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/tradingspaces.html">Trading Spaces</a></i>)<br />
<br />
Does the fact that there is a TV show about homemaking, or about anything else, indicate an obsession with that subject?</li><li>(<i>Nearly every thing she portrayed in a negative light was labeled "traditional".  She also mentioned some mumbo-gumbo about non-fiction not really existing--while it was covered with the idea that an autobiography is really just a story told about a real person, it branched into real relativistic hogwash.</i>)<br />
<br />
Definite over-use of the word "traditional" in a negative way--post-modernism is obviously her thing.  Non-fiction as fiction? Doh.</li></ul></li></ol>
<br />
Anyway, that's all for today.<br />
<br />
Oh, almost forgot--I finished the <a href="http://www.agapepc.com/em/">Agape PC English Ministry</a> site.  Well, I nearly finished it--it needs some pictures on one of the pages.
