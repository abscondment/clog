<p>The Computer Science department was unable to offer me a place in their department.  I'm pretty bummed about that.  And of course, as I read the email, Bob Dylan's <a href="http://bobdylan.com/songs/buckets.html">Buckets of Rain</a> is going on in the background with these lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Life is sad<br />
Life is a bust<br />
All ya can do is do what you must.<br />
You do what you must do and ya do it well,<br />
I'll do it for you, honey baby,<br />
Can't you tell?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah well, the email strongly encouraged me to reapply because I was a competitive applicant.  And don't get me wrong--I am excited about informatics.  I think I got a little excited about computer science, too... I'll apply in the winter and see what happens.</p>
