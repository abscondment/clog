<p>After receiving nearly 150 spam comments in less than a week, I figured that it was time to block some IP addresses.  So, I went through the list and picked out some unique ones--I haven't recieved a comment in about a week.</p>
<p>Here are IP addresses of known spammers; at least, these are the guys that I've blocked:</p>
<ul>
<li>66.119.34.58</li>

<li>193.251.169.169</li>
<li>64.159.65.78</li>
<li>212.253.2.202</li>
<li>66.114.211.138</li>

<p>Hope that helps reduce the spam received.  Also, I'd suggest downloading and installing <a href="http://james.seng.cc/archives/000152.html">mt-bayesian</a>.  It filters out spam comments on Movable Type blogs, and learns as you train it.  It's very easy to install and very helpful.</p>
