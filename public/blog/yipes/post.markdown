Now, where could that homework have gone to?  Oh--there it is!

Wow, looks like its grown a bit, too.  Hmmm... time to get cracking.

I'm really really really excited about the <a href="http://students.washington.edu/bribera/brd/">Biblical Reference Database</a>.  Check it out.  Contribute!  (I will have to start marketing this thing if it's going to get off the ground).
