So, between studying some <a href="http://stat.washington.edu/murua/stat311/">really easy math masquerading as a science</a> and reading excerps from the enthralling <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?ISBN=0916888169"><i>How to Conquer the Addiction of Rock Music</i></a> I've also managed to fall asleep, eat, and otherwise be lazy.

Just kidding (although I have taken a nap and eaten today).  Statistics is going to be so simple; it took me hardly any time to do the homework, and the test is going to be a piece of cake.

To quote the dedication of the aforementioned book:

"Dedicated to Our Parents who were discerning enough to recognize the evil in rock music and who loved us enough to withstand our reaction as they led us to experience true freedom."

This book makes me really mad.  Like a "give me something to break" (even though I <i>hate</i> Limp Bizkit, the reference was almost unavoidable) sorta mad.  This book quotes pastors, "psychiatrists", personal experiences, etc., in support of the claim that: a) Rock music is addicting, b) Rock music is satanic, and so on and so forth.

That a pastor would attempt to bind Christian's consciences in such a total non-issue reminds me of John Milton's criticism of bishops of his day (<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/101/317.html">Lycidas</a>, 119-121):</p><blockquote><p>Blind mouthes! that scarce themselves know how to hold<br />
A Sheep-hook, or have learn'd ought els the least<br />
That to the faithfull Herdmans art belongs!</p></blockquote><p>It reminds me of the sermon Pastor Kelly preached last week; the flock knows the good shepherd's voice, and true shepherds will always come through Jesus.  There are many other voices vying for our attention--granted, this book isn't by any means the most harmful voice one could pay attention to, but it's also not glorifying to God at all.  Instead, it presents a picture of Christians as narrow minded, ignorant, and reactionary.  Just what we need.  Furthermore, it limits the ways in which we can give praise to God; if He can redeem my soul, than a trifling thing like Rock 'n Roll is no big deal.

I need to go to bed now.

Just remember, as the esteemed Psychiatrist quoted in <i>Conquer</i>... says, "I have never known a person who listens to such music [rock] to regularly fast or pray.  They never share verses they have memorized.  They may show emotional affirmation of God, yet have no will for personal discipline" (85).

Of course, I guess this Psychiatrist doens't know some of the kids in <a href="http://www.greenlakepc.org">Green Lake's</a> youth group, who (horror!) listen to rock and have several books of the New Testament memorized.  Or my roommate, who's quite Godly and quite into rock.  Or David, who "rocked out" to the Psalms in his own right...


I'm really going to sleep now.
