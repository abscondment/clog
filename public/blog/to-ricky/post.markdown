The world melts tonight
inspired by your hate.
Yet the anger inside you
can't make the pain away.
I offer my olive branch,
words spoken in friendship:
let it go; don't dissolve in its flame.

I cry to think of the wound yet inside you,
pain binding your heart,
naught but hatred to guide you.
No, I can't lead you back;
the bridges all burned behind you.
But I'll walk alongside on the way.

I offer my ears, to hear your distress;
my shoulder to lift up some weight from your chest;
my faith, be it dim, as a candle to guide you,
when all light in your world has faded.

Yes, I long for the days
when we joked and were merry;
let us venture back there
on the path of sincerity.
But go forth and know, whatever befalls you:
God never turns his children away.

He heals, and I wait for that day.
