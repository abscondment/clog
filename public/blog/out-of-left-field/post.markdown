So, I got back my English midterm today.  I was walkin' to class, thinking to myself, "Hmm... what grade did I get?  Probably... a 3.2; I'd be OK with that."  I didn't feel like I did very well on the long essay part of the test--perhaps because at that point my handwriting became illegible and my thoughts jumbled.  Needless to say, I was a little bit anxious about getting the test back.  I opened right to the grade when she passed it to me: 4.0 (so of course, I immediately checked the name, and then again, and then I checked the grade a few times more).  Yeah.  That was a surprise.
