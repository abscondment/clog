<p>So, I'm sitting in my apartment typing my final paper for English.  A random spurt of boredom escapes me, and I (without really thinking) enable my wireless networking card.</p>
<p>Enter this post's title: whoa.  Someone in the Barbi apartments has a wireless router.  Running.  Totally open internet access.</p>
<p>So I make my "found it!" post on my blog, and move on.</p>
