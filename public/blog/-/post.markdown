Midterms are at hand.  I'm halfway through; I have one today at 1:30, and the last one Monday at 9:30.  I can't wait to be done with them.

"Goodbye" - Elton John

And now that it's all over<br />
The birds can nest again<br />
I'll only snow when the sun comes out<br />
I'll shine only when it starts to rain

And if you want a drink<br />
Just squeeze my hand<br />
And wine will flow into the land<br />
And feed my lambs

For I am a mirror<br />
I can reflect the moon<br />
I will write songs for you<br />
I'll be your silver spoon

I'm sorry I took your time<br />
I am the poem that doesn't rhyme<br />
Just turn back a page<br />
I'll waste away, I'll waste away<br />
I'll waste away, I'll waste away<br />
I'll waste away, I'll waste away
