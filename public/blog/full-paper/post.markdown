<p>Other news, I've installed <a href="http://james.seng.cc/archives/000152.html">mt-bayesian</a>.  mt-bayesian is a <a href="http://movabletype.org">MovableType</a> plugin that uses a Bayesian algorithm to fight spam comments.  After installing, one must train with every comment posted to one's site; based on the statistical information it learns from these comments, it gives new comments a Spam rating.  Pretty cool.</p>
