Jessica is back!  I'm so happy to finally see my babe again (go ahead and say it: I'm a big baby).

I just found out that one of my classes that is scheduled to meet 5 days a week actually only meets 4!  So, I have extra time on Friday morning that I normally wouldn't have... maybe Jessica and I can actually get together and read our Bibles before school on that day!

The <acronym title="Reformed University Fellowship">RUF</acronym> leadership party was fun.  Everyone actually agreed to meet Thursday mornings at 7am...  Just think: College students who give up sleep to do something (besides party).  Pretty weird.  Pretty cool.  I hope RUF continues to grow and enrich people's lives.  Ooh oooh ooh!  I just realized that this means that Jessica actually gets to go to the leadership meetings this quarter.  That will make her happy.

Anyway... I'm off to read or eat or go to class.
