<p>I just had my oral final in Italian.  It was rather... I just don't know.  I feel like that class is definitely going to be my lowest grade.  But that's OK; I'm just fine with whatver I get.  After taking my final, I was walking towards Mary Gates Hall when I saw the blood donation station was set up at the HUB--I decided to give it a shot.  I hadn't had a non-throwup related needle until now; it felt really good to be <i>helping</i> someone instead of receiving help.  Not that I don't like to receive help when I'm sick; I'm just glad to be well.</p>
<p>I'm now downloading the first episode of Smallville (season 4).  My roommates and I have been awaiting it with much expectation.  Well... I don't think Dan is as gung-ho as the rest of us, but he should be.</p>
