Jessica, Seth (Williams), Luke B. and I made that Tuesday morning.  It was a blast.

Other news, I think I've figured out what I want to major in: <a href="http://ischool.washington.edu/">Informatics</a>.  I really, really like the list of job possibilities, and the coursework is stuff I do on my own anyway.  I might decide to add English and get a double degree, but not if it means I have to been in school longer than 4 years.  Unfortunately, one can't double major across colleges (Arts &amp; Sciences, Information) or across degree types (B.A., B.S.).  Double degree is harder; instead of merely satisfying the requirements for both degree programs, one must also earn 225 credits instead of 180.  I might be crazy for wanting to do it, but it really appeals to me.  So, I'll just afford myself every opportunity to do it, and simply not do it if it seems too ridiculous.

Whew.  Glad I at least have an idea of what I want to do now.
