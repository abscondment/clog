<p>There was another "enlargement" advertisment posted into the comments of my blog today.  Check out what the IP lookup came up with:</p>

<p>Is that just too crazy, or what?  Tunpo Elementary School is posting penis adds on my site?</p>
<p>Of course, their computer has probably been hijacked by one of the viruses that passed by earlier this year.  My Informatics class was discussing this problem; apparently, virus infection is a big problem in many countries.  In many cases, Microsoft (we'll talk about them because that <i>is</i> what a huge majority of people use) can't legally enforce the purchasing of their products overseas.  Pirated versions are readily available, and companies without the money to buy expensive software usually resort to these.  We conjectured that Microsoft is OK with this, because it reinforces the lock they have on the operating system world, and because if the company every makes it big, they will have to buy software or suffer lawsuits.</p>
<p>
The resulting problem is, however, that there is a plethora of computer systems that don't recieve security updates, either because their cracked version is rejected by the M$ system, or because they are afraid of being discovered.  With new viruses constantly appearing, this is a pretty big problem.

I don't know if this is actually the case with the Tunpo Elementary School; I mean, it could just be a teacher promoting his company... *shudder*<br />
Leave my blog alone. (I think I'll investigate comment approval or something like that...)
