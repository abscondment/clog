The creative juices that flow in my apartment are incredible (we ignore that they actually originate in the bathroom above ours, fester in the floor for a few weeks, and then drip down on our faces as we use the toilet).  Specifically, the impromptu song that was just created:

(Luke) "Ministry Central, Barbie Apartments"<br />
(Dan)  [burp burp]<br />
(Luke) "Where your soul gets fed like nothing else!"

Whoa.

Apparently, my name can be said "B-Diddy" or "Beedee"... too weird.  I don't take kindly to nicknames, but thanks, guys.
