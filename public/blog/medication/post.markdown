It just so happens I have many concerns<br />
My brother's down the road and my lover in town<br />
They both need affection<br />
And some kind of love

Well I'm the one who gives it at any given time<br />
From two in the morning to six<br />
Call me up and cry

My lover keeps it secret that we meet under covers<br />
When asked by her man if we two are lovers<br />
She says, "I hardly know him.<br />
Besides, he's not my type."

Her man's a policeman with a keen sense of trouble<br />
He's known just by danger<br />
And all kinds of liars

Brother called this morning in a terrible panic<br />
Spies in the closet, bugs in the attic<br />
He screams bloody murder saying,<br />
"We're all gonna die.

Death is upon me, I know 'cause he showed me<br />
Pictures of graveyards and us underneath."

I'm losing my hearing from my brother screaming,<br />
"They're coming to get me and<br />
Someone call the police."

Two in the morning, the phone disconnected<br />
Her man knows I'm calling, it's what I expected<br />
A note on my backdoor saying, "Baby not tonight."

So I sit with my brother who is nursing a cut wrist<br />
He's mumbling "Forgive me."<br />
And "Don't let them take me away."

I can be a good boy and stay out of trouble<br />
Jackie I love you and<br />
Don't let them take your brother

Strapped to a table, go in the electrodes<br />
"Jackie come save me the doctors will kill me."<br />
"No, they're here to help you<br />
Straighten out your mind."

The TV is blaring with some preacher saying that<br />
God is among us and he hears our cries

Lord, do me a favor<br />
It's wrong but I ask you<br />
Take my brother's life

'Cause he's sick of the suffering<br />
The pills he's inhaling<br />
The cross he is bearing<br />
That is his trouble mind
