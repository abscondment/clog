Wow.  Getting anything to work on the UW servers is a reeeaaaalll pain.  But, I finally figured out what had been daunting my progress--perl wasn't located where MT thought it was!  So, after I edited the MT files and told them to use /usr/local/bin/perl instead of /usr/bin/perl, it was all good.  Except for the whole reconfiguring-for-another-server thing I had to do after that.

But, now it works.  Yay me!

Other news: Jessica and my 2.5 year anniversary is on Monday!  I really doesn't feel like it's been that long...
