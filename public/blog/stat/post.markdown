So, I thought that I would be really behind in STAT 311, having missed my lectures (due to sickness) and a quiz section (due to the English paper I was typing).  However, after 10 minutes of class today, I realized that <b>I've done this before; 10<sup>th</sup> grade "Math Analysis" covered all of this stupid, stupid stuff</b>.  Needless to say, while I'm frustrated that I have to sit through lectures about probability and statistics, it's reassuring that I don't actually have to learn anything new and I am going to (or at least should be able to) get a high grade in this class.

P(O | D) = P(O &#8745; D) / P(D)

Silly, silly new notations.  That's all I'm really learning; well, that and new ways of applying the existing math that I already know.  I guess I am learning, it's just easier than I think a 300-level college course should be.

<acronym title="Reformed University Fellowship"><a href="http://students.washington.edu/ruf/">RUF</a></acronym> was good last night.  We (the people who have been coming/have come in the past to leadership) got together beforehand and prayed.

English is confoundingly silly at times; out of all the English teachers I have had at UW, this one is my least favorite.  I like <i>her</i>, I just don't really like her teaching style or some of the things she has to say.  But, I'm enjoying reading Pride &amp; Prejudice, and I'll probably wind up giving her a good review.  It's not so much her; it's the rabid way the class jumps to conclusions that blame the condition of Women in the 19th century on religion and conservatism.  Rosseau, whose ideas <a href="http://students.washington.edu/bribera/archives/000053.html">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> argues against, is (or so I've heard; someone correct me if I'm totally off base) totally against Christianity.  Much of the condition of women in this period is due to thinkers like Rosseau, not "stifling religious beliefs."

Anyhoooo....

Give Beethoven's 6<sup>th</sup> a listen; it's on right now, and every time I hear it I remember how much I loved falling asleep to it as a kid.
