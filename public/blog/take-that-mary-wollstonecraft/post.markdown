I've been reading <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=1551110881">Vindications: The Rights of Men and the Rights of Woman</a> by Mary Wollstonecraft.  No, I didn't just pick it up because it looked interesting; it's for my <a href="http://staff.washington.edu/ldalley/">my English class</a>.  It's a little boring (The book, not the class.  We get to read actual novels soon.).  My curiosity is piqued, however, every time Wollstonecraft says something about Biblical roles of women.  She has decided to strike out the account of Genesis regarding the <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=GEN+2&amp;version=ESV">creation of woman</a> and her <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=GEN+3&amp;version=ESV">husband ruling over her</a>.

She argues that this arrangement was concocted by Moses because he, as a man, had a prejudice against the proper place of women in society; at the same time, she cites other passages of Scripture as evidence in favor of her argument.

Firstly, if we accept the Bible as God's word, it is an all-or-nothing thing.  We can't just pick and choose which parts of it we are going to call inspired or authoritative.  If she wants to undermine the authority of scripture, she has no right to use it in favor of her points.

Secondly, we see in Proverbs that the result of following the gender structure put forth in Genesis doesn't involve those things against which Wollstonecraft argues; rather, it is much like what she argues for.

Wollstonecraft was rightly incensed at the miseducation of women.  Proverbs 31: 10-31 speaks of a woman very different from the subjected 18<sup>th</sup>/19<sup>th</sup> century woman.  Studying her (the Proverbs 31 woman) shows, however, that she exists in the framework of Biblical marriage.

Proverbs 31

10 An excellent wife who can find?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is far more precious than jewels.<br/>
11 The heart of her husband trusts in her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will have no lack of gain.<br/>
12 She does him good, and not harm,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the days of her life.<br/>
13 She seeks wool and flax,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and works with willing hands.<br/>
14 She is like the ships of the merchant;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she brings her food from afar.<br/>
15 She rises while it is yet night<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and provides food for her household<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and portions for her maidens.<br/>
16 She considers a field and buys it;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.<br/>
17 She dresses herself with strength<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and makes her arms strong.<br/>
18 She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lamp does not go out at night.<br/>
19 She puts her hands to the distaff,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her hands hold the spindle.<br/>
20 She opens her hand to the poor<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and reaches out her hands to the needy.<br/>
21 She is not afraid of snow for her household,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all her household are clothed in scarlet.<br/>
22 She makes bed coverings for herself;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her clothing is fine linen and purple.<br/>
23 Her husband is known in the gates<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he sits among the elders of the land.<br/>
24 She makes linen garments and sells them;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she delivers sashes to the merchant.<br/>
25 Strength and dignity are her clothing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she laughs at the time to come.<br/>
26 She opens her mouth with wisdom,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.<br/>
27 She looks well to the ways of her household<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and does not eat the bread of idleness.<br/>
28 Her children rise up and call her blessed;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her husband also, and he praises her:<br/>
29 "Many women have done excellently,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you surpass them all."<br/>
30 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.<br/>
31 Give her of the fruit of her hands,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let her works praise her in the gates.<br/>
(ESV)

This woman is not weak or uneducated, like those whom Wollstonecraft was attempting to vindicate.  She had a good objective; she merely backed it up with unsound theology.
