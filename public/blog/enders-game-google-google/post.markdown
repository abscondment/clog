I was browsing around when I found a link to <a href="http://www.frescopictures.com/movies/ender/endersgame_update.html">this article</a>, indicating the production of <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0812550706"><i>Ender's Game</i></a> as a movie is actually going to take place--incredible!  I just hope it doens't fizzle out like the grandiose plans that were once formed for <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0517149257"><i>The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy</i></a> movie.

In other news, I get bored sometimes.  This particular time I was bored, I visited <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> to search for nothing in particular.  Since I was <i>really</i> bored (and since I wasn't really paying attention), I typed in "google.com" as my query.  Of course, I what came up wasn't suprising: Google, as the only page.  I wanted to see their cache of themselves: <a href="http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:zhool8dxBV4J:www.google.com/+&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8">check it out for yourself</a>.  Apparently, Google is not affiliated with google.com, after all.  :D
