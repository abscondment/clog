So, I finally finished that homework at 8am.  I took a nap from 3am-6:30, after which I got back to work.  But, I finished it.  And I came up with a rather elegant algorithm to reverse a singly linked list recursively in O(n) time.

Psalm 52</p><blockquote><p><sup>1</sup>Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steadfast love of God endures all the day.<br />
<sup>2</sup>Your tongue plots destruction,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a sharp razor, you worker of deceit.<br />
<sup>3</sup>You love evil more than good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lying more than speaking what is right. Selah<br />
<sup>4</sup>You love all words that devour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O deceitful tongue.<br />
<sup>5</sup>But God will break you down forever;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will snatch and tear you from your tent;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah<br />
<sup>6</sup>The righteous shall see and fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shall laugh at him, saying,<br />
<sup>7</sup>"See the man who would not make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God his refuge,<br />
but trusted in the abundance of his riches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sought refuge in his own destruction!"<br />
<sup>8</sup>But I am like a green olive tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the house of God.<br />
I trust in the steadfast love of God<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forever and ever.<br />
<sup>9</sup>I will thank you forever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you have done it.<br />
I will wait for your name, for it is good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the presence of the godly.</p></blockquote><p>Well, I've got to go turn in the homework that I slaved over this weekend... hope I did a good job.
