<p>Even though it's the middle of the summer, I'm still thinking about papers to write.  Here's my latest idea:</p>
<p>I've been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0875523528/qid=1090905591/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/002-4901740-3327214?v=glance&amp;s=books">Every Thought Captive</a> by Richard Pratt.  It's a good, easy to understand introduction to presuppositional apologetics (I might use it to teach an <a href="http://www.uw.ruf.org">RUF</a> Bible study this fall).    While shelving the Philosophy section at Barnes &amp; Noble, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1573928321/ref=sib_rdr_dp/002-4901740-3327214?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;no=283155&amp;me=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;st=books">The Antichrist</a>, by Nietzsche.  It is Nietzsche's attack against Christianity--the fruit of his power-based philosophy and the "logical" conclusion of a worldview without God.  I say "logical" because the way one can define logic within such a worldview is inconsistant with human rationality; the logic that Nietsche depends on has no foundation upon which to rest.  I want to read his book and write a response paper, analyzing his argument in the manner presented in Pratt's book.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm only going to do this after I finish my Cryptogram Solver, which is currently in the debugging phase.</p>
