During Jessica's and my nightly <a href="http://jeopardy.com">mental wrestling match</a>, one of the categories centered around an area formerly within my expertise: wrestling -- the martial kind.

The $2,000 question centered around the following move, of which I was the unequivocal master: The Fireman's Carry.  I was so excited that I just had to make use of YouTube for demonstrative purposes.

<b>Edit:</b> Mark points out (and I wholeheartedly agree) that the above demonstration doesn't quite execute the ideal way.  Instead of rotating around with his back to the opponent and his right hip on the ground, the demonstrator would have done well to grab under his opponent's head with his left arm, controlled the opponent's left arm with his own right arm, and went chest-to-chest with the opponent whilst lifting the opponent's head.  The rotate-hip-sit thing that is shown in the video will get you thrown over your back side and pinned.
