<a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> just caught the 668<sup>th</sup> spam comment targeted at this blog since mid-February.

Akismet is a web service that provides (free for personal use, <a href="http://akismet.com/commercial/">various prices</a> for the "Big Company" or commercial blog types) <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm"><acronym title="Representational State Transfer">REST</acronym></a>-based calls centered around alleviating the problem of Spam.  Their <a href="http://akismet.com/development/api/"><acronym title="Application Program Interface">API</acronym></a> is quite simple, allowing service consumers to check whether a given message is spam, to report a given message as spam, or to report a given message as legitimate (a "ham" message).

The <a href="http://akismet.com/stats/">statistics</a> they offer are impressive, and I'll add the weight of my own experience to that impression.  Akismet hasn't missed a beat yet: every one of the 668 comments it flagged was actually spam, and it didn't make a peep about any of the valid ones.

I can't imagine administering blog comments without a system like this&mdash;especially considering the relatively low profile of my blog and the relatively large number of spam I receive.

<b>Update:</b> I misread the pricing for commercial use; it's corrected now.
