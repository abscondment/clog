Amos had a ton of fun sending Nathan an email on my laptop.  It consisted mostly of Z's, but that's only because pressing the power button doesn't write anything.

Amos really liked looking out the window to see what was going on outside.  He also thought he could climb straight up the glass, which obviously didn't work.

We headed down to the Library.  Dan and I spent some time checking out the currency display (I still can't figure out <em>why</em> the library was showing off old currency, but whatever).  We also perused the philosophy section and made longing comments about musty old books.

Amos perched on top of Aunt Bethany (or rather, on top of Elijah) and did some more window gazing.

The best part of the library: the kids' section!  They had an awesome green screen that we spent a ton of time using.  Video and pictures below.

We accidentally took some more video when leaving the library &mdash; too funny!
