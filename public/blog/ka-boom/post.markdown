<a href="http://www.microcontentnews.com/articles/googlebombs.htm">Google Bombing</a>.  basically a cool way to make people think they're searching for items tath work.  frankly, i'm so tired i have no idea what's happening.  i need to go to bed before i fall asleep.  anyway, that's what i'm doing now.
