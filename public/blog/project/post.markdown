So, I just finished <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse373/CurrentQtr/homework/proj1.html">the first project</a> for my <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/373/"><acronym title="Computer Science &amp; Engineering">CSE</acronym> 373</a> class.  It was waaay too easy.  I'll post my solution up here as soon as the due date has passed.

Been playing <a href="http://www.teragaia.com">Teragaia</a> in my spare time.  It's kinda fun, and it takes hardly any time.  Go <a href="http://216.231.36.121/register.asp">join</a> and then <a href="mailto:bribera@u.washington.edu">let me know</a>; I'll get bonus energy if you do!  (only please, actually play... this is my friend's game)

I didn't have to work last night; that was a little disappointing monetarily, but it was incredibly productive/relaxing.  Jessica and I went over to <a href="http://lukebrodine.net">Luke Brodine's</a> house and watched <a href="http://guffman.warnerbros.com/">Waiting for Guffman</a> (note: that site doesn't do the movie <i>any</i> justice--it's actually a really, really funny  movie).  All I have to say is, "Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring!"

Hehe.
