<p>Not studying, that is.</p>
<p>Dan and I are talking about the post-modernism and the loss of words' meanings.  It's much more interesting than studying for my <acronym title="Computer Science Engineering">CSE</acronym>.  In fact, we're having a great time.</p>
<p>So here's me, day-before-the-final, not studying. (I'm actually just about to start)</p>
