Happy new year, everyone.  I hope everyone had a safe and fun time last night.

Continuing the discussion about LDS members and Christianity:


I think the comments that the text book that I'll be using in my History of Christianity class next quarter has to say about the Latter-day Saints hits the nail on the head:
"It is doubtful, however, whether the [Latter-day Saints] church's doctrine may be described as Christian--for example, what appears to be a polytheistic teaching that humans may make spiritual progress and become gods in their own universes.  Apart from theological questions, the claim to possess a new, canonical revelation (supplemented by further revelations to the prophet Joseph Smith and his successors) would seem to set Mormonism apart as a new religion altogether" (Thaddeus Posey, "Christianity in the United States" in <i>The Christian Theological Tradition</i>, ed. Catherine A. Cory and David T. Landry, p. 359).

The discrepancies in theology arise because of the differing views on what is scripture.  If one accepts the Book of Mormon &amp; co. as divinely inspired, and rejects the infallibility of the Bible, then that person's beliefs will be ultimately different than the person who rejects the Book of Mormon &amp; co. and subscribes to the Bible as God's perfect word.

From the Christian (traditional Christian, that is, so as not to beg the question) perspective, the Bible's validity is very apparent.  The Dead Sea scrolls have confirmed the accuracy with which Hebrew scribes copied the Old Testament books.  Likewise, to have skepticism about the New Testament would be to "allow all of classical antiquity to slip into obscurity, for no documents of the ancient period are as well attested bibliographically as these in the New Testament" (J.W. Montgomery, <i>History of Christianity</i>, p. 29).  The Bible even declares its revelation final: "But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!" (Galatians 1:8).

As Luke pointed out, this is not to say that LDS members don't have saving faith, or even that some LDS members have more Biblical doctrine than others claiming to be Christian.

By redefining Christ, an attempt is made at redefining what is Christian.  The Bible teaches that Christ was and is eternally God; that he is both one with the Father and his own being (John 1:1-2, Hebrews 13:8).  Jesus himself claimed to be God: "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!" (John 8:58).

Though many teachings from the Bible are kept, the extra-Biblical books that Latter-day Saints claim as scripture introduce doctrine that is totally foreign to historical Christianity.  These books also change the nature of God and man in such a way that Mormonism can only be called completely different from traditional Christianity.  Though professing Christ, the added scriptures change his nature, and I can only conclude that the doctrine isn't Christian.

This isn't by any means comprehensive; it's almost 2am and I have to work tomorrow morning, so I'm going to bed.
