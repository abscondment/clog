i know pain<br />
he has lived in my gut, trapped<br />
tried to escape<br />
every hour, through violent heaves<br />
dry and shrill<br />
depositing oregano bile<br />
i fought him then<br />
i'd fight him again<br />
pain is no enemy<br />
he holds no power<br />
he bullies hearts, stomachs<br />
summons tears<br />
but he is a coward<br />
and i have seen him beaten<br />
and i know his weaknesses<br />
my lord holds the keys of death and hell<br />
pain--a loud voice<br />
temporary<br />
what is pain to me?<br />
