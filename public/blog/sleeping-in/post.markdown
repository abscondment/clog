Ugh.  My alarm didn't go off today, so I "got to" sleep in.  Yay for me -- too bad I missed some class.

Oh well, that's OK.  I'm bored out of my mind.  Got to write a philosophy paper soon, and I'm not looking forward to it.  I'm also still curious as to how I did on the biopsychology midterm...

In other news, I might be getting a laptop.  That would be nice -- then I wouldn't be stuck here at this computer all day.  :D
