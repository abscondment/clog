A day ago we pushed out a new release that has some pretty cool <a href="http://jobster.blogs.com/blog_dot_jobster_dot_com/2007/03/jobsters_march_.html">new features</a>.  My personal favorite is the "<a href="http://jobster.com/at/contact">Manage your network <sup>beta</sup></a>"&mdash;that'll be very useful to job seekers.

After the recent <a href="http://houseofhaug.net/blog/archives/2007/03/11/lost-hedgehog">departure of some good friends</a>, things are being rearranged a little.  A lot, actually&mdash;we're <a href="http://www.authorama.com/alice-in-wonderland-10.html">throwing our lobsters</a> out to sea, so to speak, and focusing on other things.   This is good news, from my perspective&mdash;I'm (largely) saying "Goodbye!" to the Java application that was previously my main focus, and I'm now focusing on some Rails work which will effect the consumer site.  Also, I think my automated tag suggestions will make it into the profile import/creation flow soon.
