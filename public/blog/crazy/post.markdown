My COMPLIT Professor is crazy.  Crazy!  By that I mean he's really, really funny.  I'm excited about that class.

<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse410/04sp/">CSE 410</a> will be a fun class too--although it's not so fun that I have to <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=0471250600">buy</a> two pricy <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?isbn=1558604286">textbooks</a>.

English will be interesting.  Only one day in class so far, and the teacher has already said enough that I can tell she's a total postmodern.  It's not all bad, though--we did get to watch a 20 minute clip from a Woody Allen movie.

I'll have my Informatics class today--hope that goes well.
