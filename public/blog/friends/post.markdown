It's really great to have friends who you can talk with and whose advice usually sits right in sync with what the Bible says.  Jessica and I are really blessed with the church, the friends, and the parents we have; I'm incredibly thankful.  It's really a mystery the way that life works itself out--but through everything God's hand is evident in everything.  (I still don't know <i>where</i> in some things, but I know it's there)

Anyway, that's my little burst of contentedness.

"So when I'm lost in a crowd<br />
I hope that you'll pick me out<br />
How I long to be found<br />
The grass grew high, I laid down<br />
Now I'm waiting for a hand<br />
To lift me up, help me stand<br />
I've been laying so low<br />
Don't wanna lay here no more<br />
Don't wanna lay here no more"
