So, I decided to aid my (and other's) studying by typeing up a <a href="http://students.washington.edu/bribera/phil/">quiz using all the multiple choice questions from my philosophy class</a>.  The actual quiz framework took about 25 minutes to write; the questions themselves took about an our or two to enter.  It was fun, and a good way to study--I took the test and only missed one (and that one I missed because I didn't read the answers thoroughly--silly me!).

Now I have to work on the subject I don't enjoy: biopsychology.
Oh well...

Other news, <a href="http://bankofamerica.com">Bank of America</a> tried to withdraw (actually, the did withdraw this amount, and then corrected it) $19.75 for a check that I wrote out to be $16.75.  The only reason I noticted it at all is because they have a scanned image of every check of yours that is cashed when you log into their website; I look at them obsessively, for who knows what reason.  I noticed that the check was made out for $3.00 less than what had been taken out...
So I stuck it to them.

No, literally--I walked into corporate HQ, got the check, and taped it to the CEO.


OK, I lie; I called customer service.
