I just read a <a href="http://geology.com/articles/racetrack-playa-sliding-rocks.shtml">weird article about mysterious sliding rocks</a> &mdash; since my mind turns to humor when something is eluding explanation, the first things I thought were:
<ul><li>This brings a new meaning to the idea of an "Unmoved Mover".</li><li>What an odd way for the stones to "cry out".</li></ul>

Even if no one (so far) can decipher the physics or geology behind this, we can marvel at the cool pictures that come along with the article. Maybe someone will organize races &mdash; I'd put $5 on the grey pokey one.
