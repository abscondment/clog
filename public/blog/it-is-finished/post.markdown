My undergraduate work is completed.  Here's the <a href='/brendan/blog/files/poster.pdf' title='poster.pdf'>poster</a> and <a href='/brendan/blog/files/final-report.pdf'>final report</a> for my TomeTracker project.  I expect to work on it more during the next few months, but as far as my class is considered it's done.

I need to go to bed.  Needless to say, I'm glad to be done with school, and I'm really excited to be starting work at Jobster full-time next week.
