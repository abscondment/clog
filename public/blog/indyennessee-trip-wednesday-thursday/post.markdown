Nathan was able to stay home to play on Wednesday, and &mdash; as evidenced below &mdash; play we did.  The girls got their hair done in the morning; we boys spent our time playing with OSX's "say" utility.  We used it to play a somewhat unsuccessful prank on the ladies when they came home, but it turned into a great group activity.

We then went to the <a href="http://www.imamuseum.org">Indianapolis Museum of Art</a>, which was really cool.  They have a nice collection, and I was especially pleased to find <a href="http://www.imamuseum.org/explore/artwork/894?highlight=182">Ribera's Aristotle</a> among those paintings in the European section.  There was also a really cool installation in the lobby that has inspired me to do something for a yet-to-be-determined future Thread Art Night.

This stained glass window was taken from the building that Redeemer owns, prior to Redeemer coming into possession of the building.  Since the building originally housed <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/bh23.html">Benjamin Harrison's</a> church and the stained glass is a great example of work by Tiffany, the former owners of the building donated the whole window to the museum.

We walked around after getting Thai food; Amos really wanted to hold my keys, and did a great job not losing them.  He also put on quite a show any time a car with thumping bass would drive by.

Rockin' the bellies.

We got ice cream and sat down by the river.  The ducks were nice, but the geese were a tad aggressive.  Or so Jessica was convinced.

In the evening, we picked up a bottle of <a href="http://www.laphroaig.com/whiskies/15yo/index.asp?expanded=15_year_old">15-year old Laphroaig</a> and played Cranium.  The guys had fun talking about the wonderful complexity of scotch; so much fun, in fact, that we didn't even mind that the girls <em>stomped</em> us in the game.

Remember the crazy installation that is pictured in my first post about this trip?  Early Thursday morning Nathan, Dan and I met two other guys from Redeemer (one of whom is the artist who made the installation) and had a lot of fun playing background/meditative music, using the installation's plethora of percussive parts.  After we got back, packed, and ate lunch, we had to say goodbye.  I hate goodbyes.
