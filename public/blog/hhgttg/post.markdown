No, I haven't forgotten what vowels are.  <acronym title="Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy">HHGTTG</acronym> is a great <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0517542099">book</a> by Douglas Adams.

Anyway, word on the street (actually, the 'net) is that a <a href="http://hitchhikers.movies.go.com/">movie is in progress</a>, finally.  I'm amazed it's actually coming together--after Douglas Adams died three years ago, all hope of actually seeing this day was pretty much lost.  It's a good thing to see that there's enough of a fanbase to warrant hollywood carrying this plan to fruition.

I've got to get reading.  Ugh.
