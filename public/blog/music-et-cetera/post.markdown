Don't you hate it when people say "<i>eck</i> cetera"?  I do.  Seriously, the word is <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=et%20cetera">et cetera</a>.

Anyway....

Nathaniel and I are doing a little talk about music and worldview for the youth group this Sunday.  We're going to use examples of popular song with worldviews; try to get people to think about what they're hearing, and whether life actually works that way.  Although we haven't figured out which 2-3 we're actually going to play, the final candidates are (click the song title for lyrics):

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/coldplay/32627.html">Green Eyes</a> by Coldplay</li>
<li><a href="http://www.encyclopedia-metallica.com/lyrics/lyr-met2.shtml">Sad but True</a> by Metallica</li>
<li><a href="http://www.linkin-park-lyrics.com/in-the-end.htm">In the End</a> by Linkin Park</li>
<li><a href="http://www.followmearound.com/lyrics/exitmusic.html">Exit Music [for a film]</a> by Radiohead</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rexer.com/nin/gaveup.html">gave up</a> by Nine Inch Nails</li>
<li><a href="http://www.plyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/dontknowwhenbutadayisgonnacome.html">Don't know when, but a day is gonna</a> come by Bright Eyes</li>
</ul>

All these songs betray some way of looking at the world.  We're going to talk about what each song we play is saying, and what the Bible has to say about its message.

Ick.  Time for me to leave and get on my hour and ten minute bus trip--yay for reading time!
