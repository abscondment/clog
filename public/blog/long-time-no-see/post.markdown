<p>It's been quite a while since I updated.  That's partially due to my busyness, and mostly due to my not having internet access (although we just discovered that placing a wireless enabled laptop on a certain windowsill allows us to leach off our neighbors until the landlord gets around to installing his own network).</p>
<p>So to make a long story short, I'm in an apartment.  I have 2 other roommates currently, and we're looking for a 4<sup>th</sup>.  It's pretty awesome, although we're in need of some living room furniture.  Anyway, I've got to go (enter the busyness factor)...</p>
