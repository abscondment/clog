In an interview about <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071118-pirate-bay-faces-prince-pressure-private-investigators-in-foreign-cars.html">mounting legal pressure against The Pirate Bay</a>, admin Peter Sunde says:

<blockquote><em>"We're not even worried, since the Internet is too big for morally upset people to get it their way."</em></blockquote>

It always amuses me when people confuse legal and moral issues. They're not at all interdependent.

As with the intersection of any moral system and any legal system, there are four possibilities:
<ul>
  <li>There are moral things that are legal.</li>
  <li>There are legal things that are immoral.</li>
  <li>There are moral things that are illegal.</li>
  <li>There are illegal things that are immoral.</li>
</ul>
