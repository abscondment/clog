Yesteday Dan and I went to <a href="http://www.recycledcycles.com/">Recycled Cycles</a>, which is pretty close to <a href="http://www.washington.edu/" title="The University of Washington">UW</a>  I picked up a lock for my bike, while dan got some new rims for a frame he bought a while ago.  I still haven't figured out how old my bike is or what the manufacturer's reputation is--I probably should have asked, but I forgot.

After browsing the bike shop, we went to the <a href="http://students.washington.edu/ruf/" title="Reformed University Fellowship">RUF</a> guys' movie night.  I had to leave early (before the movie, even), but I did get a game of chess in during the time I was there.  I forgot how much I like chess--and how thrilling it can be.  It's pretty funny how a little game like that makes my heart race.  I still have to read my book on the Queen's Indian opening; that might have helped the beginning of my game yesterday.  I won anyway, but the start was a bit shaky.

Other news, I had my last first midterm yesterday (meaning the last of the first set).  The bus got me there 5~10 minutes late, so I was scrambling to get done.  It's funny, but I had a little foreshadowing of the thrill that playing chess later that evening gave me when I was taking the test (at one point, it was doubtful as to whether I was going to be able to finish it all.  I did, though).  The only difference was, the test wasn't really a game; I think I had a little more real nervousness and I went away with real satisfaction.


"Carry You" by <a href="http://www.thefiretheft.com/">The Fire Theft</a>

carry you in my breath<br />
i'm going nowhere waiting for the future to begin<br />
every single step is just another reason to forget who i've become<br />
carry you with all my regret<br />
how can you change your mind after all the dreams that we once shared?<br />
when will i disappear into the days' design<br />
ever being always seeing never dying<br />
like a random rain cloud that passes the sky<br />
just moving on?<br />
carry me in your breath<br />
i've never needed anything but love<br />
broken love<br />
carry me with all your promise<br />
how can i turn away after all the things that we once shared?<br />
never wanted to throw it away pretending that you were never my friend<br />
i can no longer stumble around reaching for a dream that could have been<br />
when will we disappear into the days' design<br />
ever being always seeing never dying<br />
like a random rain cloud that passes the sky<br />
just moving on?
