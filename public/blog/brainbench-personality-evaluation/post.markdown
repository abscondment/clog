I just took one of the <a href="http://www.brainbench.com/xml/bb/common/testcenter/freetests.xml">free Brainbench tests</a>: a Personality Evaluation.  While these results aren't really news to me, it's still a fun exploration into one's self.  These tests also gain some credence in my eyes, since they all seem to say similar things each time I take them.

You are quite introverted. Socially, you prefer a more
relaxed, low-key environment, rather than the hustle and
bustle of a wild night in the city. You tend not to talk a
lot, but when you do people listen, because when you say
something it has meaning. You are not seeking the
limelight, usually you prefer to let the attention-mongers
do their thing while you observe. In an unfamiliar setting,
you tend to be cautious and shy while you evaluate the
circumstances. You prefer to avoid conflict, so you do not
put yourself into a threatening situation. Your shyness may
be perceived as unfriendly, but that could not be further
from the truth. People need to be patient with you and take
the time to get to know the complex, private you.

<strong>Your Agreeableness: Candid VS Considerate</strong>
You are very candid. You are very good at making tough and
absolute, objective decisions. You are not trying to win a
popularity contest by making sure everyone is happy. You
are trying to make smart choices. As a result, people may
find you to be intimidating. You have a realistic,
no-nonsense outlook on life and are more interested in
truth and impartial justice rather than being sympathetic.
You have very high self-esteem, which works well with your
ability to be self-reliant and tough-minded. These traits
are especially beneficially since you prefer to work alone
and do not seek approval from others. With regard to your
relations with others, you tend to be cautious. You do not
blindly trust people. Sometimes you are unwilling to let
others see the real you, so you tend to be somewhat guarded.

<strong>Your Self-Control: Impulsive VS Cautious</strong>
You are moderately impulsive. At times you can be
impulsive, but not to the point where you are jeopardizing
work or relationships. You know when to follow rules, but
you also know when to bend rules that are not set in stone.
If your home or work space gets a little messy, you do not
get upset or feel compelled to tidy up. You do not have to
have perfect order in your life to feel good about yourself
or your environment. You tend to be more on the fun side of
spontaneity, and enjoy being flexible with your plans and
your life. In general, you prefer to make short-term goals
rather than long-term goals.

<strong>Your Anxiety Level: Excitable VS Relaxed</strong>
You are moderately relaxed. You do not dwell on how others
think of you. You are confident and poised in social
situations, you do not think that everyone is staring at
you and dwelling on your imperfections. You are able to
stay focused in pressure-filled circumstances, and you are
especially good at thinking clearly in stressful
situations. You rarely get angry. If you do, it passes
quickly and you are able to move forward without feeling
negative emotions. In general, you are easy-going,
confident, and secure. This is especially helpful in
frustrating situations where others are not as tranquil.
You have no problem coping with stress. You may feel the
stress, but you deal with it very well. You tend to not be
a jealous person, which makes you very easy to deal with at
work and in personal relationships. People can count on you
not to be emotionally irrational.

<strong>Your Openness to Change: Practical VS Imaginative</strong>
You are slightly practical. It is apparent to those who
meet you that you are well educated. You are able to speak
on a complex level to one audience, but adjust to a more
basic level for another. You are bright and capable of
thinking logically. On one hand you are down-to-earth and
traditional, while on the other hand you are creative and
imaginative. Sometimes you feel more comfortable with
familiarity and routine in your life, other times new and
novel experiences are more enjoyable. You are not afraid to
try new things. You tend to like to do a variety of
different activities, so you do not grow bored.

<strong>The way you Think/Reason: Concrete VS Abstract</strong>
You are very abstract in your thinking. You tend to be
quick to grasp ideas, are a fast learner and intelligent.
You possess a hallmark of intelligence that potentially
separates human beings from earlier life forms, the ability
to think about future consequences before acting on an
impulse. Your reasoning activity involves contemplation of
long-range goals, organizing and planning routes to these
goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face of
short-lived impulses to the contrary.  You also have keen
interests in intellectual matters and love to play with
ideas and think theoretically.  You tend to be open-minded
to new and unusual ideas, and like to debate intellectual
issues.  You often enjoy riddles, puzzles, and brainteasers.
