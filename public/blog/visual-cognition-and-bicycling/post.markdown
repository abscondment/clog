London Transport is running an interesting ad campaign to encourage drivers to watch out for bicyclists.

What interests me most about this is the fact that it's a verbatim copy of some <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr01/blindness.html">very interesting visual cognition research</a> done in the late 90s.  Take a look at the <a href="http://viscog.beckman.uiuc.edu/grafs/demos/15.html">original video here</a> (warning: 7.5mb Java Applet).

I found the new video <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/03/cyclist-awareness.php">via treehugger</a>, but they make no mention of the original research.
