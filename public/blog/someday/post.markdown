i am the cry<br />
screaming against avalanche, landslide<br />
disappearing absorbed

the crush<br />
of frozen gravel trod under,<br />
barefoot bleeding

the echo<br />
lost deep in murmuring rivers<br />
of tears for you

the trail<br />
of crimson; dried, dull etched words that burn:<br />
"Your life is not your own."
