<p>There's a challenge out.  You too can be God!  Simply incredible.</p>

<p>What will you do?  Who will you heal?<br />
Will you end suffering?<br />
Will you eliminate evil?<br />
&lt;sarcasm&gt;Of course&lt;/sarcasm&gt; you can do it better than the real God; after all, why hasn't he done that yet?

"I've collected a great, great deal about Russian children, Alyosha. There was a little girl of five who was hated by her father and mother.... You see, I must repeat again, it is a peculiar characteristic of many people, this love of torturing children, and children only.... It's just their defenselessness that tempts the tormentor, just the angelic confidence of the child who has no refuge and no appeal that sets his vile blood on fire....</p>
<p>
This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture by those cultivated parents. They beat her, thrashed her, kicked her for no reason till her body was one bruise. Then, they went to greater refinements of cruelty -- shut her up al night in the cold and frost in a privy, and because she didn't ask to be taken up at night... they smeared her face and filled her mouth with excrement, and it was her mother, her mother did this. And that mother could sleep, hearing the poor child's groans! Can you understand why a little creature, who can't even understand what's done to her, should beat her little aching heart with her tiny fist in the dark and cold, and weep her meek unresentful tears to dear, kind God to protect her?... Do you understand why this infamy must be and is permitted?... Why, the whole world of knowledge is not worth that child's prayer to 'dear, kind God'!...</p>
<p>
Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace and rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature -- that baby beating its breast with its fist, for instance -- and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears, would you consent to be the architect on those conditions? Tell me, and tell the truth."</p>
<p>
"No, I wouldn't consent," said Alyosha softly.</p>

8 "Would you discredit my justice?<br />
Would you condemn me to justify yourself?<br />
9 Do you have an arm like God's,<br />

I tell you, don't try.  It's a claim you can't hold.  It'll kill you.  I don't have the answer to evil.  The issue is a struggle, is more than a struggle.  It's fighting for your life against something bigger and stronger and faster than you.  It's like dying.

Epilogue:<br />
<br />
He held himself with the self-possessed manner only a self deceiving man can manage, like a wild tiger restrained by imaginings.  He was a rock, he was an island--he's a smear of blood now.  I watched the surf beat; the black blood welled up, and then filled the sea.  As I saw him drowning I cried, "Why why why why?" for I was lifted out and above the water.  Anger knotted his heart, he sunk like a leaden anchor.  Eyes turned inward, his world shrunk to hold only his own image--who can see God if God hides from him?--and I wept helpless tears.<br />Why am I saved?<br />
