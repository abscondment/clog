I'm making a concerted effort to eliminate the need for having PHP and MySQL installed on this server (which is running again, if you hadn't noticed). As soon as I can figure out how to hack the Wordpress import script to import from one database (MySQL) and export to a different one (PostgreSQL), I'll issue the final "emerge -C" command.

In other news, I've followed some <a href="http://lar5.com/cube/">great instructions and mastered the Rubik's cube</a>, I've finished the last Harry Potter book, and I'm sad that four of my favorite friends are moving away.
