<img style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em" id="image22" alt="Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: the text book." src="http://threebrothers.org/brendan/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/dyn.jpg" /> I'm sitting at the dining room table at 2:12 AM working on nonlinear dynamics and chaos, and I make a startling realization:

I've been droppin' Taylor series like they're <em>hot</em> for almost 6 years now.  That's an impressive thing.

My other realizations are that 1) I really need to get some sleep, 2) This homework has <em>way</em> too many problems, and 3) qualitative, geometric solutions to differential equations are really quite powerful and awesome.

I think fixed points in my brain bifurcate transcritically, at approximately r<sub>c</sub> = 1:00 AM.
