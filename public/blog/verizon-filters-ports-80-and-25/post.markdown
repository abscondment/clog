The gracious hosts of this server have recently upgraded to Verizon <acronym title="Fiber Optic Service">FiOS</acronym>, which should have been a great boon to threebrothers.org; however, Verizon filters ports 80 and 25.  This is why, dear reader, I have reconfigured my blog to live on port 8080.  Apparently, these ports are only used for &quot;business purposes&quot;, and businesses need to pay more.  While I now have more bandwidth, I am also greatly impaired in my ability to use it.

This further polarizes my beliefs about business rules and technology, which can be summarized as, "don't interfere, you incompetent nincompoops!"  I could spend an inordinate amount of time and energy dissecting the various facets of idiocy I have uncovered attempting to obtain an <acronym title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</acronym> at my new apartment.  To peel back the layers of tampering, throttling, and filtering from this proverbial onion would make even the most stalwart vegetable cutter cry.  I read through the fine, disingenuous print of each company's <acronym title="Terms of Service">TOS</acronym>, and each time it is like turning on the shower and receiving a cascade of putrescent sewage.  Each one of these companies is a moldering, pus-filled lesion on the face of the internet.

So, please: clean up your acts.  Bandwidth should not be accompanied by throttles, filters, or intermittent magical interference.  If I have a service plan advertised at a speed of 3.0 megabits per second, I expect:

<ol>
  <li>That this speed is consistent &mdash; it doesn't change unless there is a <em>problem</em> with the service, and problems ought not to be expected.</li>
  <li>The bandwidth I purchase can be used across the entirety of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model"><acronym title="Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model">OSI model</acronym></a>. This means no monkeying with anything &mdash; very similar to the consistency requirement from point 1.</li>
  <li>Since there are 2,592,000 seconds in a 30-day period, I expect to be able to download approximately 949.22 gigabytes of data in a 30-day period.  Of course, the same &quot;problems&quot; disclaimer applies here &mdash; of course I don't expect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_nines">5 nines</a> of uptime, or even 3.</li>
</ol>


Postscript:

I'm aware that Verizon is the only brand with which I am associating this vituperation, and I don't think that's entirely fair.  Verizon's port filtering leans towards the innocuous end of the moldering, pus-filled lesion spectrum &mdash; it's a few orders of magnitude less despicable than some of the despicable things being done by ISPs.  However, it happens to be the particular lesion that I am faced with looking at, and so I will not forgo associating their name with their actions.
