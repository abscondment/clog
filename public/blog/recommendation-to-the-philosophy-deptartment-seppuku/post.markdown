I hereby recommend <a href="http://www.msu.edu/~couilla3/ninja/seppuku.htm">Seppuku</a> to the Philosophy department.  Grading a Scantron test really can't take this long.  If it does, and I'm just being ignorant and insensitive (which I know I'm capable of doing), then I'm sorry, and stay your frisbees.

More seriously, Jessica left town today.  I'm really going to miss her--she'll be gone until January!  I'm really bummed that I won't get either Christmas or New Year's with her.... although it does make me grateful that I get to be with her the rest of the time.

My computer just freaked me out: <acronym title="AOL Instant Messenger">AIM</acronym> started playing an audio advertisement, just out of thet blue.  It was pretty weird.  I hate AOL, seriously.  Their all about advertising to you, trying to get you to buy something, etc.  Not one note about providing quality, friendly products--all they see is the dollar $ign on my forehead.

Good thing internet groups like the <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> have influence and respect.

I am finally done with school; I turned in my English final.  3 ~1/2 page questions, and one 3 page question (all single-spaced).  A synthesis of the second half of the course, the questions covered 3 novels, 1 movie, etc.  Done done done done done.
